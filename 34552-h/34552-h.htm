<br /><i>AN ASSIGNMENT FOR PENNY</i></h2>
<p>Penny Parker, leaning indolently against the
edge of the kitchen table, watched Mrs. Weems stem
strawberries into a bright green bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tempting bait for Dad&rsquo;s jaded appetite,&rdquo; she remarked,
helping herself to the largest berry in the
dish. &ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t eat them, I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d leave those berries alone,&rdquo; the
housekeeper protested in an exasperated tone. &ldquo;They
haven&rsquo;t been washed yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind a few germs,&rdquo; laughed Penny.
&ldquo;I just toss them off like a duck shedding water. Shall
I take the breakfast tray up to Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wish you would, Penny,&rdquo; sighed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right tired on my feet this morning.
Hot weather always did wear me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She washed the berries and then offered the tray
of food to Penny who started with it toward the
kitchen vestibule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now where are you going, Penelope Parker?&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just to the automatic lift.&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s blue eyes
were round with innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try to ride in that contraption
again!&rdquo; scolded the housekeeper. &ldquo;It was never built
to carry human freight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not exactly freight,&rdquo; Penny said with an injured
sniff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strong enough to carry me. I know
because I tried it last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You walk up the stairs like a lady or I&rsquo;ll take the
tray myself,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems threatened. &ldquo;I declare, I
don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;ll grow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; grumbled Penny good-naturedly.
&ldquo;But I do maintain it&rsquo;s a shameful waste of energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Balancing the tray precariously on the palm of her
hand she tripped lightly up the stairway and tapped
on the door of her father&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>Anthony Parker, editor and owner of the <i>Riverview
Star</i> sat propped up with pillows, reading a day-old
edition of the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Morning, Dad,&rdquo; said Penny cheerfully. &ldquo;How is
our invalid today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no more an invalid than you are,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Parker testily. &ldquo;If that old quack, Doctor Horn,
doesn&rsquo;t let me out of bed today&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll simply explode, won&rsquo;t you, Dad?&rdquo; Penny
finished mischievously. &ldquo;Here, drink your coffee and
you&rsquo;ll feel less like a stick of dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker tossed the newspaper aside and made a
place on his knees for the breakfast tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I hear an argument between you and Mrs.
Weems?&rdquo; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No argument, Dad. I just wanted to ride up in
style on the lift. Mrs. Weems thought it wasn&rsquo;t a civilized
way to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not.&rdquo; The corners of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
mouth twitched slightly as he poured coffee from the
silver pot. &ldquo;That lift was built to carry breakfast trays,
but not in combination with athletic young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bore, this business of growing up,&rdquo; sighed
Penny. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be natural at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to manage rather well with all the restrictions,&rdquo;
her father remarked dryly.</p>
<p>Penny twisted her neck to gaze at her reflection in
the dresser mirror beyond the footboard of the big
mahogany bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mind growing up if only I&rsquo;m able to develop
plenty of glamour,&rdquo; she said speculatively. &ldquo;Am
I getting any better looking, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve noticed,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker gruffly,
but his gaze lingered affectionately upon his daughter&rsquo;s
golden hair. She really was growing prettier each
day and looked more like her mother who had died
when Penny was a little girl. He had spoiled her, of
course, for she was an only child, but he was proud
because he had taught her to think straight. She was
deeply loyal and affectionate and those who loved
her overlooked her casual ways and flippant speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the paper boy this morning?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker asked between bites of buttered toast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t time for him yet, Dad,&rdquo; said Penny demurely.
&ldquo;You always expect him at least an hour
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First edition&rsquo;s been off the press a good half hour,&rdquo;
grumbled the newspaper owner. &ldquo;When I get back to
the <i>Star</i> office, I&rsquo;ll see that deliveries are speeded up.
Just wait until I talk with Roberts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been doing a pretty strenuous job of
running the paper right from your bed?&rdquo; inquired
Penny as she refilled her father&rsquo;s cup. &ldquo;Sometimes
when you talk with that poor circulation manager I
think the telephone wires will burn off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m a tyrant, am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everyone knows your bark is worse than your
bite, Dad. But you&rsquo;ve certainly not been at your best
the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker&rsquo;s eyes roved about the luxuriously furnished
bedroom. Tinted walls, chintz draperies, the
rich, deep rug, were completely lost upon him. &ldquo;This
place is a prison,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>For nearly a week the household had been thrown
completely out of its usual routine by the editor&rsquo;s illness.
Overwork combined with an attack of influenza
had sent him to bed, there to remain until he should
be released by a doctor&rsquo;s order. With a telephone at
his elbow, Mr. Parker had kept in close touch with
the staff of the <i>Riverview Star</i> but he fretted at confinement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t half look after things,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;And now Miss Hilderman, the society editor, is sick.
I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;ll get a good story on the Kippenberg
wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny looked up quickly. &ldquo;Miss Hilderman is ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, DeWitt, the city editor, telephoned me a few
minutes ago. She wasn&rsquo;t able to show up for work
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see why he should bother you about
that, Dad. Can&rsquo;t Miss Hilderman&rsquo;s assistant take over
the duties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The routine work, yes, but I don&rsquo;t care to trust her
with the Kippenberg story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it something extra special, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, you&rsquo;ve heard of Mrs. Clayton Kippenberg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name is familiar but I can&rsquo;t seem to recall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clayton Kippenberg made a mint of money in the
chain drug business. No one ever knew exactly the
extent of his fortune. He built an elaborate estate about
a hundred and twenty-five miles from here, familiarly
called <i>The Castle</i> because of its resemblance to an
ancient feudal castle. The estate is cut off from the
mainland on three sides and may be reached either
by boat or by means of a picturesque drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds interesting,&rdquo; commented Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw the place myself. In fact, Kippenberg
never allowed outsiders to visit the estate. Less than a
year ago a rumor floated around that he had separated
from his wife. There also was considerable talk that
he had disappeared because of difficulties with the
government over income tax evasion and wished to
escape arrest. At any rate, he faded out of the picture
while his wife remained in possession of <i>The Castle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now she is marrying again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is Mrs. Kippenberg&rsquo;s daughter, Sylvia, who
is to be married. The bridegroom, Grant Atherwald,
comes from a very old and distinguished family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the story should be so difficult to
cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg has ruled that no reporters or
photographers will be allowed on the estate,&rdquo; explained
Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does complicate the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it may not be easy to persuade Mrs. Kippenberg
to change her mind. I rather doubt that our
assistant society editor has the ingenuity to handle the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you send one of the regular reporters?
Jerry Livingston, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry couldn&rsquo;t tell a tulle wedding veil from one
of crinoline. Nor could any other man on the staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could get that story for you,&rdquo; Penny said suddenly.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker gazed at his daughter speculatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think you could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Penny spoke with assurance. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
I bring in two perfectly good scoops for your old
sheet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did. Your Vanishing Houseboat
yarn was one of the best stories we&rsquo;ve published in a
year of Sundays. And the town is still talking about
Tale of the Witch Doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what I went through to get those stories, a
mere wedding would be child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too confident,&rdquo; warned Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If
Mrs. Kippenberg doesn&rsquo;t alter her decision about reporters,
the story may be impossible to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I try?&rdquo; Penny asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker frowned. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I hate
to send you so far, and then I have a feeling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put my thoughts into words. It&rsquo;s just that
my newspaper instinct tells me this story may develop
into something big. Kippenberg&rsquo;s disappearance never
was fully explained and his wife refused to discuss
the affair with reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kippenberg might be at the wedding,&rdquo; said Penny,
thinking aloud. &ldquo;If he were a normal father he would
wish to see his daughter married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow my line of thought, Penny. When
you&rsquo;re at the estate&mdash;if you get in&mdash;keep your eyes
and ears open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll let me cover the story?&rdquo; Penny cried
in delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll telephone the office now and arrange for
a photographer to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to send Salt Sommers,&rdquo; Penny suggested
quickly. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t act as know-it-all as some of the
other lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had Sommers in mind,&rdquo; her father nodded as he
reached for the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have a lot more than Salt Sommers in <i>my</i>
mind,&rdquo; laughed Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another big story, Dad! A scoop for the <i>Star</i> and
this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny implanted a kiss on her father&rsquo;s cheek and
skipped joyously from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>

<br /><i>REPORTERS NOT WANTED</i></h2>
<p>In the editorial room of the <i>Riverview Star</i> heads
turned and eyebrows lifted as Penny, decked in her
best silk dress and white picture hat, clicked her high-heeled
slippers across the bare floor. Jerry Livingston,
reporter, stopped pecking at his typewriter and stared
in undisguised admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t our Bright Penny,&rdquo; he bantered.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t recognize you for a minute in all those glad
rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my work clothes,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
covering the Kippenberg wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry pushed his hat farther back on his head and
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough assignment. From what I hear of the Kippenberg
family, you&rsquo;ll be lucky if they don&rsquo;t throw
the wedding cake at you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Penny laughed and went on, winding her way
through a barricade of desks to the office of the society
editor. Miss Arnold, the assistant, was talking over the
telephone, but in a moment she finished and turned
to face the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Parker,&rdquo; she said stiffly. An
edge to her voice told Penny more clearly than words
that the young woman was nettled because she had
not been trusted with the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; replied Penny politely. &ldquo;Dad
said you would be able to give me helpful suggestions
about covering the Kippenberg wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much I can tell you, really. The ceremony
is to take place at two o&rsquo;clock in the garden, so
you&rsquo;ll have ample time to reach the estate. If you get
in&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Arnold placed an unpleasant emphasis upon
the words&mdash;&ldquo;take notes on Miss Kippenberg&rsquo;s gown,
the flowers, the decorations, the names of her attendants.
Try to keep your facts straight. Nothing infuriates
a bride more than to read in the paper that
she carried a bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley and roses
while actually it was a bouquet of some other flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to infuriate Miss Kippenberg,&rdquo; promised
Penny.</p>
<p>Miss Arnold glanced quickly at her but the girl&rsquo;s
face was perfectly serene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I can tell you, Miss Parker,&rdquo; she said
shortly. &ldquo;Bring in at least a column. For some reason
the city editor rates the wedding an important story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; responded Penny, and arose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Salt Sommers was waiting for her when she came
out of the office. He was a tall, spare young man, with
a deep scar down his left cheek. He talked nearly as
fast as he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re all set, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Penny found herself three paces behind but she
caught up with the photographer as he waited for the
elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking Minny along,&rdquo; Salt volunteered, holding
his finger steadily on the signal bell. &ldquo;May come
in handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minny?&rdquo; asked Penny, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miniature camera. You can&rsquo;t always use the
Model X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Penny. Deeply embarrassed, she
remained silent as the elevator shot them down to
the ground floor.</p>
<p>Salt loaded his photographic equipment into a battered
press car which was parked near the loading
dock at the rear of the building. He slid in behind the
wheel and then as an afterthought swung open the
car door for Penny.</p>
<p>Salt seemed to know the way to the Kippenberg
estate. They shot through Riverview traffic, shaving
red lights and tooting derisively at slow drivers. In
open country he pressed the accelerator down to the
floor and the car roared down the road, only slackening
speed as it raced through a town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you travel when you&rsquo;re in a hurry?&rdquo;
Penny gasped, clinging to her flopping hat.</p>
<p>Salt grinned and lifted his foot from the gasoline
pedal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I get in the habit of driving fast.
We have plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they rode, Penny gathered scraps of information.
The Kippenberg estate was located six miles
from the town of Corbin and was cut off from the
mainland on three sides by the joining of two wide
rivers, one with a direct outlet to the ocean. Salt did
not know when the house had been built but it was
considered one of the show places of the locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll have much trouble getting our
story?&rdquo; Penny asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All depends,&rdquo; Salt answered briefly. He slammed
on the brake so suddenly that Penny was flung forward
in the seat.</p>
<p>Another car coming from the opposite direction
had pulled up at the side of the road. Penny did not
recognize the three men who were crowded into the
front seat, but the printed placard, <i>Ledger</i> which was
pasted on the windshield told her they represented a
rival newspaper in Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck, Les?&rdquo; Salt called, craning his neck
out the car window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well turn around and go back,&rdquo; came
the disgusted reply. &ldquo;The old lady won&rsquo;t let a reporter
or a photographer on the estate. She has a guard stationed
on the drawbridge to see that you don&rsquo;t get
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car drove on toward Riverview. Salt sat staring
down the road, drumming his fingers thoughtfully on
the steering wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re up against a tough assignment,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;If Les can&rsquo;t get in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back without at least an attempt,&rdquo;
announced Penny firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; Salt cried with sudden approval.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get on the estate somehow if we have to swim
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jerked the press card from the windshield, and
reaching into the back seat of the car, covered the
Model X camera with an old gunny sack. The miniature
camera he placed in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use advertising our profession too early in the
game,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>Twelve-thirty found Penny and Salt in the sleepy
little town of Corbin. Fortifying themselves with a
lunch of hot dog sandwiches and pop, they followed
a winding, dusty highway toward the Kippenberg
estate.</p>
<p>Presently, through the trees, marking the end of
the road, an iron drawbridge loomed up. It stood in
open position so that boats might pass on the river
below. A wooden barrier had been erected across the
front of the structure which bore a large painted sign.
Penny read the words aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;&lsquo;DANGEROUS DRAWBRIDGE&mdash;KEEP OFF.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt drew up at the side of the road. &ldquo;Looks as if
this is as far as we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he said in disgust.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other road to the estate. I&rsquo;ll bet that &lsquo;dangerous
drawbridge&rsquo; business is just a dodge to keep
undesirables away from the place until after the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded gloomily. Then she brightened as
she noticed an old man who obviously was an estate
guard standing at the entrance to the bridge. He
stared toward the old car as if trying to ascertain
whether or not the occupants were expected guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to talk with him,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretend that you&rsquo;re a guest,&rdquo; suggested Salt. &ldquo;You
look the part in that fancy outfit of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny walked leisurely toward the drawbridge. Appraisingly,
she studied the old man who leaned comfortably
against the gearhouse. A dilapidated hat
pulled low over his shaggy brows seemed in keeping
with the rest of his wardrobe&mdash;a blue work shirt and
a pair of grease-smudged overalls. A charred corn-cob
pipe, thrust at an angle between his lips, provided sure
protection against the mosquitoes swarming up from
the river below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; began Penny pleasantly. &ldquo;My
friend and I are looking for the Kippenberg estate.
We were told at Corbin to take this road but we seem
to have made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t made no mistake, Miss,&rdquo; the old man
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then is the estate across the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are guests to reach the place? I see the
sign says the bridge is out of commission. Are we supposed
to swim over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; the old man answered
evenly. &ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg has a launch that takes the
folks back and forth. It&rsquo;s on the other side now but
will be back in no time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait in the car out of the hot sun,&rdquo; Penny
said. She started away, then paused to inquire casually:
&ldquo;Is this drawbridge really out of order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was deliberate in his reply. He blew
a ring of smoke into the air, watched it hover like a
floating skein of wool and finally disintegrate as if
plucked to pieces by an unseen hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, and no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t exactly sick
but she sure is ailin&rsquo;. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust no heavy contraption
on this bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condemned by the state, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss, and I&rsquo;ll tell you why. This here bridge
doesn&rsquo;t belong to the state. It&rsquo;s a private bridge on a
private road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Odd that Mrs. Kippenberg never had it repaired,&rdquo;
Penny remarked. &ldquo;It must be annoying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to all them that don&rsquo;t like launches. As for
Mrs. Kippenberg, she don&rsquo;t mind. Fact is, she ain&rsquo;t
much afraid of the bridge. She drives her car across
whenever she takes the notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bridge does operate!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it does. That&rsquo;s my job, to raise and lower it
whenever the owner says the word. But the bridge
ain&rsquo;t fit for delivery trucks and such-like. One of them
big babies would crack through like goin&rsquo; over sponge
ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I rather envy your employer,&rdquo; said Penny
lightly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t every lady who has her own private
drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is kind of exclusive-like that way, Miss. Mrs.
Kippenberg she keeps the drawbridge up so she&rsquo;ll have
more privacy. And I ain&rsquo;t blamin&rsquo; her. These here
newspaper reporters always is a-pesterin&rsquo; the life out
of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded sympathetically and walked back
to make her report to Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess twice,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;The old bridgeman
just took it for granted I was one of the wedding
guests. It will be all right for us to go over in the
guest launch as soon as it arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>Salt gazed ruefully at his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look much like a guest. Think I&rsquo;ll pass inspection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could get by as one of the poor relations,&rdquo;
grinned Penny. &ldquo;Pull your hat down and
straighten your tie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt shook his head. &ldquo;A business suit with a grease
spot on the vest isn&rsquo;t the correct dress for a formal
wedding. You might get by but I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then should I try it alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get those pictures somehow,&rdquo; stated
Salt grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we could hire a boat of our own,&rdquo; Penny
suggested. &ldquo;Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t look as well as if
we arrived on the guest launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what we can line up,&rdquo; Salt said, swinging
open the car door.</p>
<p>They walked to the river&rsquo;s edge and looked in both
directions. There were no small boats to be seen. The
only available craft was a large motor boat which
came slowly downstream toward the open drawbridge.
Penny caught a glimpse of the pilot, a burly
man with a red, puffy face.</p>
<p>Salt slid down the bank toward the water&rsquo;s edge,
and hailed the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you, Cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Two bucks to take
me across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The man inclined his head, looked steadily at Salt
for an instant, then deliberately turned his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five!&rdquo; shouted Salt.</p>
<p>The pilot gave no sign that he had heard. Instead,
he speeded up the boat which passed beneath the
drawbridge and went on down the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>GIFT TO THE BRIDE</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; said Penny, peering
after the retreating boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard me all right,&rdquo; growled Salt as he scrambled
back up the high bank.</p>
<p>Noticing a small boy in dirty overalls who sat at
the water&rsquo;s edge fishing, he called to him: &ldquo;Say, sonny,
who was that fellow, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; answered the boy, barely turning his head,
&ldquo;but his boat has been going up and down the river
all morning. That&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t catch anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat rounded a bend of the river and was lost
to view. Only one other craft appeared on the water,
a freshly painted white motor launch which could be
seen coming from the far shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the guest boat now,&rdquo; remarked
Penny, shading her eyes against the glare of the sun.
&ldquo;It seems to be our only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to get aboard and see what happens,&rdquo;
proposed the photographer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>They walked leisurely back toward the guard at
the drawbridge, timing their arrival just as the launch
swung up to the landing. With a cool assurance which
Penny tried to duplicate, Salt stepped aboard, nodded
indifferently to the wheelsman, and slumped down in
one of the leather seats.</p>
<p>Penny waited uneasily for embarrassing questions
which did not come. Gradually she relaxed as the
boatman took no interest in them and the guard&rsquo;s
attention was fully occupied with other cars which
had driven up to the drawbridge.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, two elderly women, both elegantly
gowned, were helped aboard the boat by their
chauffeur. One of the women stared disapprovingly
at Salt through her lorgnette and then ignored him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get by all right,&rdquo; Salt whispered confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until Mrs. Kippenberg sees us,&rdquo; warned
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll keep out of her way until we have our
story and plenty of pictures. Once we&rsquo;re across the
river it will be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; muttered Penny.</p>
<p>While Salt&rsquo;s task of taking pictures might prove relatively
simple, she realized that her own work would
be anything but easy. She could not hope to gather
many facts without talking to a member of the family,
and the instant she admitted her identity she likely
would be ejected from the grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I boasted I&rsquo;d bring in a front page story,&rdquo; she
thought ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be lucky if I get a column of
routine stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat was moving slowly away from the landing
when the guard at the drawbridge called in a loud
voice: &ldquo;Hold it, Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Salt stiffened in their chairs, fearing they
were to be exposed. But they were both greatly relieved
to see that a long, black limousine had drawn
up at the end of the road. The launch had been
stopped so that additional passengers might be accommodated.</p>
<p>Salt nudged Penny&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant Atherwald,&rdquo; he contributed, jerking his
head toward a tall, well-built young man who had
stepped from the car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his picture plenty of
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bridegroom?&rdquo; Penny turned to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. He&rsquo;s one of the blue-bloods, but they say
he&rsquo;s a little short on ready cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, dressed immaculately in formal
day attire, and accompanied by two other men, came
aboard the launch. He bowed politely to the elderly
women and his gaze fell questioningly upon Penny
and Salt. But if he wondered why they were there,
he did not voice his thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>As the boat put out across the river Penny watched
Grant Atherwald curiously. It seemed to her that he
appeared nervous and preoccupied. He stared straight
before him, clenching and unclenching his hands. His
face was colorless and drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nervous and worried,&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;I
guess all bridegrooms are like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp &ldquo;click&rdquo; sounded in her ear. Penny did not
turn toward Salt, but she caught her breath, knowing
what he had done. He had dared to take a picture of
Grant Atherwald!</p>
<p>She waited, feeling certain that the sound must have
been heard by everyone in the boat. A full minute
elapsed and no one spoke. When Penny finally glanced
at Salt he was gazing serenely out across the muddy
water, his miniature camera shielded behind a felt hat
which he held on his knees.</p>
<p>The boat docked. Salt and Penny allowed the others
to go ashore first, and then followed a narrow walk
which wound through a deep lane of evergreen trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt,&rdquo; Penny asked abruptly, &ldquo;how did you get
that picture of Atherwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snapped it through a hole in the crown of my
hat. It&rsquo;s an old trick. I always wear this special hat
when I&rsquo;m sent out on a hard assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought a cannon had gone off when the shutter
clicked,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;We were lucky you
weren&rsquo;t caught.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Emerging from behind the trees, they obtained their
first view of the Kippenberg house. Sturdily built of
brick and stone, it stood upon a slight hill, its many
turrets and towers commanding a view of the two
rivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice layout,&rdquo; Salt commented, pausing to snap a
second picture. &ldquo;Wish someone would give me a
castle for a playhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the moat and found themselves directly
behind Grant Atherwald again. Before the
bridegroom could enter the house a servant stepped
forward and handed him a sealed envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told to give this to you as soon as you arrived,
sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Grant Atherwald nodded, and taking the letter,
quickly opened it. A troubled expression came over
his face as he scanned the message. Without a word
he thrust the paper into his pocket. Turning, he
walked swiftly toward the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, did you notice how queerly Atherwald
looked&mdash;&rdquo; Penny began, but the photographer interrupted
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t a Chinaman&rsquo;s chance
of getting in the front door. That boy in the fancy
knickers is giving everyone the once over. Let&rsquo;s try
a side entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Without attracting attention they walked quickly
around the house and located a door where no servant
had been posted. Entering, they passed through a
marble-floored vestibule into a breakfast room
crowded with serving tables. Salt nonchalantly helped
himself to an olive from one of the large glass dishes
and led Penny on toward the main hall where many
of the guests had gathered to admire the wedding
gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t swipe any of the silver,&rdquo; Salt said jokingly.
&ldquo;I think that fellow over by the stairway is
a private detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be looking at us with a suspicious
gleam in his eyes,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t
get tossed out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right if Mrs. Kippenberg doesn&rsquo;t see
us before the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Mr. Kippenberg could be here,
Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely. It&rsquo;s my guess that fellow will never
be seen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad doesn&rsquo;t share your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Salt admitted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep watch for
him, but it would just be a lucky break if it turns out
he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mingling with the guests, they walked slowly about
a long table where the wedding gifts were displayed.
Penny gazed curiously at dishes of solid silver, crystal
bowls, candlesticks, jade ornaments, tea sets and service
plates encrusted with gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing trashy here,&rdquo; muttered Salt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such an elegant display,&rdquo; Penny
whispered in awe. &ldquo;Do you suppose that picture is one
of the gifts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She indicated an oil painting which stood on an
easel not far from the table. So many guests had
gathered about the picture that she could not see it
distinctly. But at her elbow, a woman in rustling silk,
said to a companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, a genuine Van Gogh! It must have cost
a small fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the couple had moved aside, Penny and Salt
drew closer to the easel. One glance assured them
that the painting had been executed by a master. However,
it was the subject of the picture which gave
Penny a distinct start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at that!&rdquo; she whispered to Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; he asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you notice anything significant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do. It&rsquo;s just a nice picture of a drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point, Salt!&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s eyes danced
with excitement. &ldquo;A drawbridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer glanced again at the painting,
this time with deeper interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it looks a lot like the bridge which was built
over the river,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You think this picture
is a copy of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Penny shook her head impatiently. &ldquo;Salt, your
knowledge of art is dreadful. This Van Gogh was
painted ages ago and is priceless. Don&rsquo;t you see, the
drawbridge has to be a copy of the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory sounds reasonable,&rdquo; Salt admitted. &ldquo;I
wonder who gave the painting to the bride? There&rsquo;s
no name attached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was good at kid games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s clear as crystal,&rdquo; Penny declared, keeping
her voice low. &ldquo;This estate with the drawbridge
was built by Clayton Kippenberg. He must have been
familiar with the Van Gogh painting, and had the
real bridge modeled after the picture. For that matter,
the painting may have been in his possession&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think the picture was presented to Sylvia
Kippenberg by her father?&rdquo; Salt broke in quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Only a person very close to the bride
would have given such a gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m,&rdquo; said Salt, squinting at the picture thoughtfully.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re right it means that Clayton Kippenberg&rsquo;s
whereabouts must be known to his family. His
disappearance may not be such a deep mystery to
Mamma Kippenberg and daughter Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Salt, wouldn&rsquo;t it make a grand story if only
we could learn what became of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Front page stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We simply must get the story somehow! If Mrs.
Kippenberg would just answer our questions about
this drawbridge painting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Mamma Kippenberg isn&rsquo;t going to break
down and tell all,&rdquo; Salt said dryly. &ldquo;But buckle on
your steel armor, little girl, because here she comes
now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>BEHIND THE BUSHES</i></h2>
<p>A large, middle-aged woman in rose-colored silk,
crossed the room directly toward Salt and Penny.
Her pale blue eyes glinted with anger and there were
hard lines about her mouth. She walked haughtily,
but with grim purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we do some fast talking, out we go!&rdquo; muttered
Salt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Kippenberg, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood their ground, knowing they had been
recognized as intruders. But before the woman could
reach them she was stopped by a servant who spoke
a few words in a low tone. For a moment Mrs. Kippenberg
forgot about Penny and Salt as a new problem
presented itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk with anyone now,&rdquo; she said in an agitated
voice. &ldquo;Tell them to come back later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They insist upon talking with you now, Madam,&rdquo;
replied the servant. &ldquo;Unless you see them they say
they will look around for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg drew herself up sharply
as if from a physical blow. &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the library, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not hear the woman&rsquo;s reply, but she
turned and followed the servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved by the bell,&rdquo; mumbled Salt. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get
away from here before she comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed through the throng and reached a
long hallway. Mrs. Kippenberg had disappeared, but
as they drew near an open door they caught sight of
her again. She stood just inside the library, her back
toward them, talking with two men who wore plain
gray business suits.</p>
<p>Penny half drew back, fearing discovery, but Salt
pulled her along. As they went quietly past the door
they heard Mrs. Kippenberg say in an excited voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I tell you he isn&rsquo;t here! Why should I
try to deceive you? We have nothing to hide. You
are most inconsiderate to annoy me at such a time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Salt did not hear the reply. They
reached an outside door and stepped down on a flagstone
terrace which overlooked the garden at the rear
of the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were those men, do you suppose?&rdquo; Penny
whispered, fearful that her voice might betray them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers of the law, I should guess,&rdquo; Salt replied
in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Government men?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Likely as not. I don&rsquo;t believe the locals would
bother her. Anyway she&rsquo;s got the wind up and you
can tell she&rsquo;s scared silly in spite of all her back talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think they&rsquo;re after?&rdquo; Penny
said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I had just one guess,&rdquo; Salt replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
say they are after Mr. Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, why else would they come sleuthing around
at a time like this? The answer is simple. Daughter gets
married. Papa wants to see his darling do it. Therefore,
boys, we&rsquo;ll spread a net for Daddy and he might
plump right into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way a G man&rsquo;s mind works?&rdquo; laughed
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would take it that Kippenberg is no fool,&rdquo;
Salt went on. &ldquo;If they really have a &lsquo;man wanted&rsquo; sign
hung on him he would be too cagey to come around
here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were standing beside the stone balustrade
which bounded the terrace. Below them the green
foliage of the gardens formed a dark background for
the playing fountains. A cool breeze drifted in from
the river and rattled a window awning just over their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in an exposed place here,&rdquo; observed Salt
uneasily. &ldquo;Maybe we ought to find a hole somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never learn anything in a hole,&rdquo; Penny objected.
&ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;re not making much progress in
running down any sort of story. I do wish we could
have heard more of that conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get thrown out on our collective ear before
we even have a chance to snap a picture of the blushing
bride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pictures! Pictures!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
you photographers think about. How about poor little
me and my story? After all, you can&rsquo;t bring out a
paper full of nothing but pictures and cigarette ads.
You need a little news to go with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like to work too fast,&rdquo; complained Salt.
&ldquo;Right now the thing to do is to keep out of sight.
I&rsquo;m telling you the minute Mrs. Kippy finishes with
those men she&rsquo;ll be gunning for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to go into hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, let&rsquo;s mosey out into the rose garden,&rdquo; Salt
proposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a few shots and then we&rsquo;ll duck
under somewhere and wait until the ceremony starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well for you,&rdquo; grumbled Penny,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t write much of a story without talking to
some member of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt started off across the velvety green lawn toward
the rose arbor where the service was to be held.
Penny followed reluctantly. She watched the photographer
take several pictures before a servant approached
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the man said coldly, &ldquo;but
Mrs. Kippenberg gave orders no pictures were to be
taken. If you are from one of the papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw her in the house just a minute ago,&rdquo;
Salt replied carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir,&rdquo; the servant apologized, retreating.</p>
<p>Salt finished taking the pictures and slipped the
miniature camera back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s amble down toward the river and wait,&rdquo;
he said to Penny. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll blossom forth just as the
ceremony starts. Mrs. Kippy won&rsquo;t dare interrupt it
to have us thrown off the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked down a sloping path, past a glass-enclosed
hothouse and on toward a grove of giant
oak and maple trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant here when you&rsquo;re away from the
crowd,&rdquo; Penny remarked, gazing up at the leafy canopy.
&ldquo;I wonder where this path leads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, down to the river probably. With water on
three sides of us that&rsquo;s a fairly safe guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which rivers flow past the estate, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Big Bear and the Kobalt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same old muddy Kobalt which is near our
town,&rdquo; said Penny in surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always think of
it as a river of adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of Mud-Cat Joe and his Vanishing Houseboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded and a dreamy look came into her
eyes. &ldquo;So much happened on the Kobalt, Salt. Remember
that big party Dad threw at the Comstock Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? Jerry Livingston decided to sleep in Room
Seven where so many persons had disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he was spirited away almost before our
very eyes,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;Days later Mud-Cat Joe
helped me fish him out of this same old Kobalt. For
awhile we didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever pull through or be
able to tell what had happened to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as the grand finale you and your friend, Louise
Sidell, solved the mystery and secured a dandy story
for the <i>Star</i>. Those were the days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as if they were gone forever,&rdquo; laughed
Penny. &ldquo;Other good stories will come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Salt, &ldquo;but covering a wedding is
pretty tame in comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet this one does have interesting angles,&rdquo; Penny
insisted. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you almost feel mystery lurking about
the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I do feel a mosquito sinking his stinger
into me.&rdquo; Salt slapped vigorously at his ankle.</p>
<p>They followed the path on toward the river, coming
soon to a trail which branched off to the right.
Across it had been stretched a wire barrier and a neatly
lettered sign read:</p>
<p class="bq">NO ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose the path is blocked off?&rdquo;
Penny speculated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out,&rdquo; Salt suggested with a sudden flare
of interest. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll run into something worth
a picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, not wishing to disregard the sign,
yet eager to learn what lay beyond the barrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Salt, &ldquo;just put your little conscience
on ice. We&rsquo;re here to get the &lsquo;who, when, why and
where.&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll never be a first class newspaper reporter
if you stifle your curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;I will follow. Only
isn&rsquo;t it getting late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt looked at his watch. &ldquo;We still have a safe
fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to step over the wire, only to have Penny
reach out and grasp his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Salt turned toward her in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think someone is watching us! I&rsquo;m sure I saw
the bushes move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nerves are jumpy,&rdquo; Salt jeered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the foliage to the left moved ever
so slightly and a dark form could be seen creeping
stealthily away along the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>THE MISSING BRIDEGROOM</i></h2>
<p>Salt acted instinctively. Leaping over the wire
barrier he dived into the bushes. Hurling himself
upon the man who crouched there, he pinned him
to the ground. The fellow gave a choked cry and
tried to pull free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Salt muttered, coolly sitting
down on his stomach. &ldquo;Snooping, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me up!&rdquo; the man cried savagely. &ldquo;Let me
up, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you up when you explain what you were
doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you impudent young pup!&rdquo; the man spluttered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who will explain. I am Mrs.
Kippenberg&rsquo;s head gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt&rsquo;s hand fell from the old man&rsquo;s collar and he
apologetically helped him to his feet. Penny, who
had reached the scene, stooped down and recovered
a trowel which had slipped from the gardener&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a little mistake on my part,&rdquo; Salt mumbled.
&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fault of yours you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the old man
snapped. &ldquo;A fine howdydo when a person can&rsquo;t even
loosen earth around a shrub without being assaulted
by a ruffian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener was a short, stout man with graying
hair. He wore coarse garments, a loose fitting pair of
trousers, a dark shirt and battered felt hat. But Penny
noticed that his hands and fingernails were clean and
there were no trowel marks around any of the
shrubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt isn&rsquo;t exactly a ruffian,&rdquo; she said as the photographer
offered no defense. &ldquo;After all, from where
we stood it looked exactly as if you were hiding in
the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you both need glasses,&rdquo; the man retorted
rudely. &ldquo;A person can&rsquo;t work without getting down
on his hands and knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you digging?&rdquo; Penny asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just starting in when this young upstart
leaped on my back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Salt, &ldquo;but I thought you were trying
to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you anyway?&rdquo; the gardener demanded
bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not guests. I can tell that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have a very discerning eye,&rdquo; replied Salt
smoothly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the <i>Riverview Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporters, eh?&rdquo; The old man scowled unpleasantly.
&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve no business being here at all.
You&rsquo;re not wanted, so get out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only after a few facts about the wedding,&rdquo;
Penny said. &ldquo;Perhaps you would be willing to tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing, Miss! If anything is given
out to the papers it will have to come from Mrs.
Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; Salt acknowledged. He glanced
curiously down the path which had been blocked off.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; The gardener spoke irritably. &ldquo;This
part of the estate hasn&rsquo;t been fixed up. That&rsquo;s why
it&rsquo;s closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had bent down, pretending to examine a
shrub at the edge of the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the name of this bush?&rdquo; she inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An azalea,&rdquo; the gardener replied after a slight
hesitation. &ldquo;Now get out of here, will you? I have
my work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Salt rejoined as he and Penny
moved away. &ldquo;No need to get so tough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>They stepped over the barrier wire and retraced
their way toward the house. Several times Penny
glanced back but she could not see the old man. He
had slipped away somewhere among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that fellow was a gardener,&rdquo; she
said suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you notice his nice clean hands and fingernails?
And then when I asked him the name of that
bush he hesitated and called it an azalea. I saw another
long botanical name attached to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he just made a mistake, or said the first
thing that came into his head. He wanted to get rid
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he did,&rdquo; nodded Penny. &ldquo;Yet, when he
found out we were from the <i>Star</i> he didn&rsquo;t threaten
to report us to Mrs. Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was afraid to report us,&rdquo; Penny went on with
conviction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent he has no more right here
than we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt had lost all interest in the gardener. He glanced
at his watch and quickened his step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it two o&rsquo;clock yet?&rdquo; Penny asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just. After all the trouble we&rsquo;ve had getting here
we can&rsquo;t afford to miss the big show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from the grove, Salt and Penny were
relieved to see that the ceremony had not yet started.
The guests were gathered in the garden, the minister
stood waiting, musicians were in their places, but the
bridal party had not appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just in time,&rdquo; Salt remarked.</p>
<p>Penny observed Mrs. Kippenberg talking with one
of the ushers. Even from a distance it was apparent
that the woman had lost her poise. Her hands fluttered
nervously as she conferred with the young man
and a worried frown puckered her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something seems to be wrong,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I
wonder what is causing the delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Salt could reply, the usher crossed the lawn,
and came directly toward them. Penny and Salt instantly
were on guard, thinking that he had been sent
by Mrs. Kippenberg to eject them from the grounds.
But although the young man paused, he did not look
squarely at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Atherwald anywhere?&rdquo; he
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bridegroom?&rdquo; Salt asked in astonishment.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Is he missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; the young man returned stiffly. &ldquo;Certainly
not. He merely went away for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Atherwald came over on the same boat with
us,&rdquo; Penny volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you see him enter the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he spoke to one of the servants and then went
toward the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice which path he took?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it was this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from down by the river,&rdquo; added
Salt. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see him there. The only person we
met was an old gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usher thanked them for the information and
hurried on. When the man was beyond hearing, Salt
turned to Penny, saying jubilantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe we&rsquo;ll get a big story after all! Sylvia
Kippenberg jilted at the altar! Hot stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you jumping to swift conclusions, Salt?
He must be around here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always serious business when a man is late for
his wedding. Even if he does show up, daughter Sylvia
may take offense and call the whole thing off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too hopeful,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
probably be here in another minute. I don&rsquo;t believe
he would have come at all if he had intended to slip
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have lost his nerve at the last minute,&rdquo;
Salt insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald did act strangely on the boat,&rdquo; Penny
said reflectively. &ldquo;And then that message he received&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have sent it to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an excuse for getting away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any reason for going to so much unnecessary
trouble,&rdquo; Penny argued. &ldquo;If he intended to
jilt Miss Kippenberg how much easier it would have
been not to come here at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see what we can learn,&rdquo; Salt suggested.</p>
<p>Their interest steadily mounting, they went on
toward the house and stationed themselves where
they could see advantageously. It was evident by this
time that the guests suspected something had gone
amiss. Significant glances were exchanged, a few persons
looked at their watches, and all eyes focused
upon Mrs. Kippenberg who tried desperately to carry
off an embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. The crowd became increasingly
restless. Finally, the usher returned and spoke quietly
to Mrs. Kippenberg. They both retired to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if there will be no wedding today,&rdquo;
Salt declared. &ldquo;Atherwald hasn&rsquo;t been located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dare use the story unless I&rsquo;m absolutely
certain of my facts,&rdquo; Penny said anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kippenberg and the usher had stepped into the
breakfast room. Posting Penny at the outside door,
Salt followed the couple. From the hallway he could
hear their conversation distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he must be somewhere on the grounds,&rdquo; the
matron argued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it myself,&rdquo; the young man replied.
&ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s disappearance is very mysterious to
say the least. Several persons saw him arrive here and
everything seemed to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thirty-five, Mrs. Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late? Oh, this is dreadful! How can I face
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just how you feel,&rdquo; the young man said
with sympathy. &ldquo;If you wish I will explain to the
guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, this will disgrace us,&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg
murmured. &ldquo;Wait until I have talked with Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned suddenly and reached the hall door
before Salt could escape. Her eyes blazed with wrath
as she faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are!&rdquo; she cried furiously. &ldquo;How dare
you disregard my orders? I will have no reporters
on the grounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a photographer,&rdquo; Salt said meekly enough.
&ldquo;Sorry to intrude but I&rsquo;ve been assigned to get a picture
of the bride. It won&rsquo;t take a minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg broke in, her
voice rising higher. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take no pictures here.
Not one! Now get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture might be better than a story that the
bridegroom had skipped out,&rdquo; Salt said persuasively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;you!&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg&rsquo;s face became
fiery red. She choked as she tried to speak.
&ldquo;Get out, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt did not retreat. Instead he took his camera
from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one picture, Mrs. Kippenberg. At least of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing that the photographer meant to take it
whether or not she gave permission, the woman suddenly
lost all control over her temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; she cried furiously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whirling about, she seized an empty plate from the
tall stack on the serving table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold that pose!&rdquo; chortled Salt, goading her on.</p>
<p>The woman hurled the plate straight at him. Salt
gleefully snapped a picture and dodged. The plate
crashed into the wall behind him, splintering into a
half dozen pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell action picture!&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try to use it!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Kippenberg.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone your editor! I&rsquo;ll have you
discharged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; offered the usher, taking out his wallet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you ten dollars for that picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt shook his head, still smiling broadly.</p>
<p>The sound of the crash had brought servants running
to the scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have this person ejected from the grounds,&rdquo; Mrs.
Kippenberg ordered harshly. &ldquo;And see that he doesn&rsquo;t
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just outside the house, Penny huddled against the
wall, trying to make herself as inconspicuous as possible.
She had heard everything. As Salt backed out
the door he did not glance at her but he muttered for
her ears alone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on your own now, kid. I&rsquo;ll be waiting at
the drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant later two servants seized him roughly
by the arms and escorted him down the walk to the
boat landing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>A RING OF WHITE GOLD</i></h2>
<p>Penny waited anxiously, but Mrs. Kippenberg
did not come to the outside door. Nor had it occurred
to the two servants that the girl was connected
in any way with the photographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my own,&rdquo; she repeated to herself. &ldquo;On my
own with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt had his picture and it was up to her to get a
good story. Until now she had depended upon his
guidance. With all support withdrawn she suddenly
felt uncertain and incompetent.</p>
<p>Penny waited a few minutes before gathering sufficient
courage to enter the long hallway. One glance
assured her that the breakfast room was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg probably went upstairs to talk
with her daughter,&rdquo; she reasoned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear
what they say to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the guests assembled in the garden, only a
few persons lingered in the house. No one paid heed
to Penny as she moved noiselessly up the spiral stairway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>A bedroom door stood slightly ajar. Hearing a low
murmur of voices, Penny paused. Framed against the
leaded windows she saw Sylvia Kippenberg talking
with her mother. Despite a tear-streaked face the girl
was very lovely. She wore a long flowing gown of
white satin and the flowers at the neckline were outlined
with real pearls. Her net veil had been discarded.
A bouquet of flowers lay on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could Grant do such a cruel thing?&rdquo; Penny
heard her sob. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe it of him, Mother.
Surely he will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kippenberg held the girl in her arms, trying
to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nearly three now, Sylvia. The servants have
searched everywhere. A man of his type isn&rsquo;t worthy
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I love him, Mother. And I am sure he loves
me. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible he would do such a thing
without a word of explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will explain, never fear,&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg said
grimly. &ldquo;But now, we must think what has to be
done. The guests must be told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother!&rdquo; Sylvia went into another paroxysm
of crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other way, my dear. Leave everything
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Before Penny realized that the interview had ended,
Mrs. Kippenberg stepped out into the hall. Her eyes
focused hard upon the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a reporter!&rdquo; she accused harshly. &ldquo;I remember,
you were with that photographer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;&rdquo; began Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing,&rdquo; the woman cried. &ldquo;How
dare you intrude in my home and go about listening
at bedroom doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg, if only you will calm yourself,
I may be able to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me?&rdquo; the woman demanded. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be able to give you a clue as to what became
of Grant Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The anger faded from Mrs. Kippenberg&rsquo;s face. She
came close to Penny, grasping her arm with a pressure
which hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen him? Tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came over in the same boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly after one o&rsquo;clock. He was stopped at the
front door by a servant who handed him a note. Mr.
Atherwald read it and walked down toward the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder which one of the servants spoke to him?
It was at the front door, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been Gregg. I&rsquo;ll talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting Penny, Mrs. Kippenberg hastened down
the stairway. She jangled a bell and asked that the
manservant be sent to her. Unnoticed, Penny lingered
to hear the interview.</p>
<p>The man came into the room. &ldquo;You sent for me,
Mrs. Kippenberg?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gregg. You were at the door when Mr.
Atherwald arrived?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you handed him a note which he
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you the note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Latch, the cook. She told me it was brought
to the kitchen door early this morning by a most
disreputable looking boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been hired to deliver it for another person,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam. The boy told Mrs. Latch that the
message came from a friend of Mr. Atherwald&rsquo;s and
should be given to him as soon as he arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea what the note contained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Kippenberg, the envelope was sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing that when the interview ended Mrs. Kippenberg&rsquo;s
wrath might again descend upon her, Penny
decided not to tempt fate. While the woman was still
talking with the servant, she slipped out of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald might have had that note sent to himself,
but I doubt it,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Either he is
still on the estate, or the boatman would have had to
take him back across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked quickly down to the dock and was
elated to find the guest launch tied up there. The
boatman answered her questions readily. He had not
seen Grant Atherwald since early in the afternoon.
Salt was the only person he had taken back across the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed any other boat leaving the estate?&rdquo;
inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats have been going up and down the river all
day,&rdquo; the man answered with a shrug. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice
any particular one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced across the water. She could see Salt
perched on the drawbridge waiting for her. But she
was not yet ready to leave the estate.</p>
<p>Ignoring his shout to &ldquo;come on,&rdquo; she turned and
walked back toward the house. Deliberately, she chose
the same path which she and Salt had followed earlier
in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A swift walk brought her to the forbidden trail
with the barrier sign. Penny glanced around to be
certain she was not under observation. Then she
stepped boldly over the wire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Passing the place where she and Salt had talked
with the gardener, she noticed his trowel lying on
the ground. There was no evidence that he had done
any work.</p>
<p>However, all along the path flowering shrubs were
well trimmed and tended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this part of the estate isn&rsquo;t fixed up,&rdquo; Penny
mused. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much nicer than the other section in my
opinion. I wonder why that gardener told so many
lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path led deeper into the woods. Rustic benches
invited one to linger, but Penny walked rapidly onward.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she came to a little clearing, and
saw before her a large, circular pool. From a gap in
the trees, warm sunshine poured down upon the bed
of flowers which flanked the cement sides, making a
circle of brilliant color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where the path leads,&rdquo; thought Penny.
&ldquo;No mystery here after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was at a loss to understand why this portion
of the estate had been closed to visitors for certainly
it was the most beautiful part. Yet there was a quality
to the beauty which the girl did not like.</p>
<p>As she stood staring at the pool, she was fully aware
of an uneasy feeling which had taken possession of
her. It was almost as if she stood in the presence of
something sinister and unknown. The gentle rustling
of the tree leaves, the cool river air blowing against
her cheek, only served to heighten the feeling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>She drew closer and peered down into the blue
depths of the pool. She could not see the bottom
plainly for the water was choked with a tangle of
feathery plants. A few yellow lilies floated on the
surface.</p>
<p>Penny absently reached out to pluck one. But as
the stem snapped off, she gave a little scream and
dropped the flower. She had seen a large, shadowy
form slithering through the water beneath her.</p>
<p>Penny backed a step away from the pool. From
among the lily pads an ugly head emerged and a
broad snout was raised above the surface for an instant.
Powerful jaws opened and closed, revealing
jagged teeth set in deep pits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An alligator!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;Such a
horrid, ugly creature! And to think, I nearly put my
hand in that water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered and watched the movements of the
alligator. Its head scooted smoothly over the water
for a short distance. Then with a swish of its tail, the
reptile submerged and the pool was as placid as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight feet long if it&rsquo;s an inch,&rdquo; estimated Penny.
&ldquo;Why would any person in his right mind keep such
a creature here? Why, it&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>She felt enraged, thinking how close she had come
to touching the alligator. Yet justice compelled her
to admit that she had only herself to blame. Deliberately,
she had disregarded the warning not to explore
the forbidden trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kippenbergs keep nice pets,&rdquo; she thought
ironically. &ldquo;If anyone fell into that pool it would be
just too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that her curiosity was satisfied, Penny had
not the slightest desire to linger near the lily pool.
With another glance down into the murky depths she
turned away, but she had taken less than a dozen steps
when she paused. Her attention was held by a bright
and shiny object which lay in the dust at her feet.</p>
<p>With a low cry of surprise she reached down and
picked up a plain band of white gold. Obviously, it
was a wedding ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where did this come from?&rdquo; Penny turned
it over on the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>Startled thoughts leaped into her mind. She felt
certain Grant Atherwald had taken this same path
earlier in the afternoon. It was logical to believe that
the ring had been his, intended for Sylvia Kippenberg.
Had he lost the band accidentally or deliberately
thrown it away?</p>
<p>Slowly, Penny&rsquo;s gaze roved to the lily pond. She
noted that the coping was so low that one who walked
carelessly might easily stumble and fall into the water.
It made her shudder to think of such a gruesome possibility,
yet she could not avoid giving it consideration.
For that matter, Grant Atherwald might have
been lured to this isolated spot. The mysterious message&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Penny delved no deeper into the problem for suddenly
she felt someone grasp her arms. With a terrified
cry she whirled about to face her assailant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>

<br /><i>THE FORBIDDEN POOL</i></h2>
<p>A wave of relief surged over Penny as she saw
that it was the old gardener who held her fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only you,&rdquo; she laughed shakily, trying to
pull away. &ldquo;For a second I thought the Bogey Man
had me for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener did not smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to keep away from here?&rdquo; he
demanded, giving her a hard shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing any h-harm,&rdquo; Penny stammered.
She kept her hand closed over the white gold ring
so that the old man would not see what she had found.
&ldquo;I just wanted to learn what was back in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you found out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener&rsquo;s tone warned Penny to be cautious
in her reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the pool is rather pretty,&rdquo; she answered carelessly.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen much nicer ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a minute or two. I really came to search for
Grant Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald? What would he be doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He disappeared an hour or so ago,&rdquo; revealed
Penny. &ldquo;The servants have been searching everywhere
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He disappeared?&rdquo; the gardener repeated incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very peculiar. Mr. Atherwald arrived at
the estate in ample time for the wedding. But after
he read a note which was delivered to him he walked
off in this direction and was seen no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down this path, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say as to that, but he started this way.
I know because I saw him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald didn&rsquo;t come here,&rdquo; the gardener said
with finality. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working around the lily pond
all afternoon and would have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s fingers closed tightly about the white gold
ring which she kept shielded from the man&rsquo;s gaze.
In her opinion the trinket offered almost conclusive
proof that the bridegroom had visited the locality.
Because she could not trust the gardener she kept her
thoughts strictly to herself.</p>
<p>The man stared down at his feet, obviously disturbed
by the information Penny had given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose harm could have befallen Mr.
Atherwald?&rdquo; she asked after a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Harm?&rdquo; he demanded irritably. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sheer nonsense.
The fellow probably skipped out. He ought to
be tarred and feathered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would enjoy doing it?&rdquo; Penny interposed
slyly.</p>
<p>The gardener glared at her, making no attempt to
hide his dislike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such treatment would be too good for anyone
who hurt Miss Sylvia. Now will you get out of here?
I have my orders and I mean to enforce them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I was going anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not strictly true, for had the gardener not
been there she would have made a more thorough
investigation of the locality near the lily pool. But
now she had no hope of learning more, and so turned
away.</p>
<p>Emerging from among the trees, she glanced toward
the rose garden. Nearly all of the wedding guests
had departed. Penny considered whether or not she
should speak to Mrs. Kippenberg about finding the
ring. Deciding against it, she joined a group of people
at the boat dock and was ferried across the river.</p>
<p>Salt awaited her at the drawbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just about gave you up,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
time for us to get back to the office or our news won&rsquo;t
be news. The wedding is definitely off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Atherwald can&rsquo;t be found.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at a drug store and telephone,&rdquo; Salt
said, pulling her toward the car. &ldquo;Learn anything
more after I left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I found a wedding ring and was nearly
chewed up by an alligator,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;It
seemed rather interesting at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer gave her a queer look as he
started the automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagination and journalism never mix,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this look like imagination?&rdquo; Penny countered,
showing him the plain band ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beside a lily pond in the forbidden part of the
estate. I feel certain it must have been dropped by
Grant Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrown away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what to think,&rdquo; Penny replied
soberly.</p>
<p>Salt steered the car into the main road which led
back to Corbin. Then he inquired: &ldquo;Did you notice
any signs of a struggle? Grass trampled? Footprints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to do any investigating. That
bossy old gardener came and drove me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you saying about alligators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, I saw one swimming around in the lily pool,&rdquo;
Penny told him earnestly. &ldquo;It was an ugly brute, at
least twelve feet long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, eight anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; Penny said indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was only a big log lying in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave an injured sniff. &ldquo;Have it your own
way. But it wasn&rsquo;t a log. I guess I can tell an alligator
when I see one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re actually right,&rdquo; Salt said unmoved, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to have snapped a picture of it. You know, this
story might develop into something big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a feeling it will, Salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Atherwald really has disappeared it should create
a sensation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the poor fellow had the misfortune to fall
or be pushed into the lily pool Dad wouldn&rsquo;t have
headlines large enough to carry it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, get a grip on yourself,&rdquo; Salt advised. &ldquo;The
<i>Riverview Star</i> prints fact, not fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because so many of Dad&rsquo;s reporters are
stodgy old fellows,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll admit
it isn&rsquo;t very likely Grant Atherwald was devoured
by the alligator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car had reached Corbin. Salt drew up in front
of a drug store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run in and telephone DeWitt,&rdquo; he said, opening
the door for her. &ldquo;And remember, stick to facts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Penny was a little frightened as she entered the
telephone booth and placed a long distance call to the
<i>Riverview Star</i>. She never failed to feel nervous when
she talked with DeWitt, the city editor, for he was
not a very pleasant individual.</p>
<p>She jumped as the receiver was taken down and a
voice barked: &ldquo;City desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Penny Parker over at Corbin,&rdquo; she began
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; snapped DeWitt. &ldquo;Talk up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny repeated her name and DeWitt&rsquo;s voice lost
some of its edge. Gathering courage, she started to
tell him what she had learned at the Kippenberg estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it,&rdquo; interrupted DeWitt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll switch you
over to a rewrite man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The connection was made and Penny began a
second time. Now and then the rewrite man broke
into the narrative to ask a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I think I have it all,&rdquo; he said finally and
hung up.</p>
<p>Penny went back to the car looking as crestfallen
as she felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they thought of the story,&rdquo;
she told Salt. &ldquo;DeWitt certainly didn&rsquo;t waste any
words of praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never does,&rdquo; chuckled the photographer.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky if you don&rsquo;t get fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one consolation,&rdquo; returned Penny, settling
herself for the long ride home. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t fire
me. Being the editor&rsquo;s daughter has its advantages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>The regular night edition of the <i>Riverview Star</i>
was on the street by the time they reached the city.
Salt signaled a newsboy and bought a paper while
the car waited for a traffic light. He tossed it over to
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is! My story!&rdquo; she cried, and then her
face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Salt. &ldquo;Did they garble
it all up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve cut it down to three inches! And not a
word about the alligator or the lost wedding ring!
I could cry! Why, I told that rewrite man enough
to fill at least a column!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway you made the front page,&rdquo; the photographer
consoled. &ldquo;They may build the story up
in the next edition after they get my pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny said nothing, remaining in deep gloom during
the remainder of the ride to the <i>Star</i> office. Salt
let her out at the front door. She debated for a moment
whether or not to go on home, but finally entered
the building.</p>
<p>DeWitt was busy at his desk as she walked stiffly
past. She hoped that he would notice how she ignored
him, but he did not glance up from the copy
before him.</p>
<p>Penny opened the door of her father&rsquo;s private office
and stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What are you doing
here? You&rsquo;re supposed to be home in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I finally persuaded the doctor to let me out,&rdquo; Anthony
Parker replied, swinging around in his swivel
chair. &ldquo;How did you get along with your assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did very well,&rdquo; Penny said aloofly.
&ldquo;But from now on I&rsquo;ll not telephone anything in. I&rsquo;ll
write the story myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t blame DeWitt or the rewrite man,&rdquo;
said Mr. Parker, smiling. &ldquo;A paper has to be careful
in what it publishes, especially about a wedding. Alligators
are a bit too&mdash;shall we say sensational?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made a similar remark about witch dolls,&rdquo;
Penny reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did eat my words that time,&rdquo; Mr. Parker admitted,
&ldquo;but this is different. If we build up a big
story about Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance, and
then tomorrow he shows up at his own home, we&rsquo;ll
appear pretty ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Penny said, turning away.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m happy to see you back in the office again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker watched her speculatively. When she
reached the door he inquired: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Today is Thursday.&rdquo; The editor took a sealed envelope
from the desk drawer. &ldquo;This is the first time
you have failed to collect your allowance in over a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be slipping.&rdquo; Penny grinned as she pocketed
the envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you open it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; Penny asked gloomily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always
the same. Anyway, I borrowed two dollars last
week so this doesn&rsquo;t really belong to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be pleasantly surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared at her father with disbelief. &ldquo;Dad!
You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ve given me a raise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly, she ripped open the envelope. Three crisp
dollar bills fluttered into her hand. With a shriek of
delight, Penny flung her arms about her father&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always try to reward a good reporter,&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;Now take yourself off because my work
is stacked a mile high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tripped gaily toward the door but it opened
before she could cross the room. An office boy came
in with a message for Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man to see you named Atherwald,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>The name produced an electrifying effect upon
both Penny and her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald!&rdquo; Mr. Parker exclaimed. &ldquo;Then he
hasn&rsquo;t disappeared after all! Show him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m staying right here,&rdquo; Penny declared, easing
herself into the nearest chair. &ldquo;I have a hunch
that this interview may concern me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>PARENTAL PROTEST</i></h2>
<p>In a few minutes the office boy returned, followed
by a distinguished, middle-aged man who carried a
cane. Penny gave him an astonished glance for she
had expected to see Grant Atherwald. It had not occurred
to her that there might be two persons with
the same surname.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Atherwald?&rdquo; inquired her father, waving the
visitor into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;James Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man spoke shortly and did not sit down. Instead
he spread out a copy of the night edition of the
<i>Star</i> and pointed to the story which Penny had covered.
She quaked inwardly, wondering what error of
hers was to be exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see this?&rdquo; Mr. Atherwald demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; inquired the editor pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are holding my family up to ridicule by printing
such a story! Grant Atherwald is my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the story incorrect?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you imply that my son deliberately jilted
Sylvia Kippenberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And actually he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Mr. Parker inquired
evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. My son is a man of honor and had
a very deep regard for Sylvia. Under no circumstance
would he have jilted her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, the wedding did not take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Mr. Atherwald admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can explain why it was postponed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened to Grant,&rdquo; Mr.
Atherwald said reluctantly. &ldquo;He left our home in
ample time for the ceremony, and I might add, was in
excellent spirits. I believe he must have been the victim
of a stupid, practical joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that suggests a new angle,&rdquo; Mr. Parker remarked
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Did your son have friends who
might be apt to play such a joke on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one of my acquaintance,&rdquo; Mr. Atherwald answered
unwillingly. &ldquo;Of course, he had many young
friends who were not in my circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had listened quietly to the conversation. She
now arose and came over to the desk. From her
pocket she took the white gold wedding ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Atherwald,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wonder if you could
identify this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man studied the trinket for a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks very much like a ring which Grant purchased
for Sylvia,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Where did you get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it lying on the ground at the Kippenberg
estate,&rdquo; Penny replied vaguely. She had no intention
of divulging the exact locality where she had picked
up the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker, &ldquo;we have supporting
facts in our possession which were not published. All
in all, I think the story was handled discreetly, with
due regard for the feelings of those involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you refuse to retract the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to oblige you, Mr. Atherwald, but
you realize such a story as this is of great interest to
our readers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You care only for sensationalism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, we try to avoid it,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
corrected. &ldquo;In this particular case, we deliberately
played the story down. If it develops that your son
actually has disappeared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it was only a practical joke,&rdquo; Mr.
Atherwald interrupted. &ldquo;No doubt my son is at home
by this time. The wedding has merely been postponed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entitled to your opinion,&rdquo; said Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;And I sincerely hope that you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least do not use that picture which your photographer
took of Mrs. Kippenberg. I&rsquo;ll pay you for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have expected such an attitude!&rdquo; Mr.
Atherwald exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the office, slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve lost another subscriber, Dad,&rdquo; said
Penny flippantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the first,&rdquo; returned her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to give Mr. Atherwald the wedding
ring, but he went off in too big a hurry. Should I go
after him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t bother, Penny. You might take it around
to the picture room and have it photographed. We
may use it as Exhibit A if the story develops into
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the alligator?&rdquo; Penny asked. &ldquo;Would
you like to have me bring that to the office, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move out of here and let me work,&rdquo; her father
retorted.</p>
<p>Penny went to the photographic department and
made her requirements known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for the ring,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
catch me trusting you boys with any jewelry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the picture was being taken Salt came by
with several damp prints in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a look at this one, Penny,&rdquo; he said proudly.
&ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg wielding a wicked plate. Will she
burn up when she sees it on the picture page?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Penny. &ldquo;Nice going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>When the ring had been returned to her she slipped
it into her pocket and left the newspaper office. Her
next stop was at a corner hamburger shop where she
fortified herself with two large sandwiches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to hold me until the dinner bell rings,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;And now to pay my honest debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A trolley ride and a short walk brought Penny to
the home of her chum, Louise Sidell. As she came
within sight of the front porch she saw her friend
sitting on the steps, reading a movie magazine. Louise
threw it aside and sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I&rsquo;m glad you came over. I telephoned
your house and Mrs. Weems said you had gone away
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Official business for Dad,&rdquo; Penny laughed. She
dropped two dollars into Louise&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what
I owe you. But don&rsquo;t go spend it because I may need
to borrow it back in a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Leaping Lena running up huge garage bills
again?&rdquo; Louise inquired sympathetically.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s second-hand car was a joke to everyone
save herself. She was a familiar figure at nearly every
garage in Riverview, for the vehicle had a disconcerting
way of breaking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to buy new spark plugs this time,&rdquo; sighed
Penny. &ldquo;But then, I should get along better from
now on. Dad raised my allowance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that call for a celebration? Rini&rsquo;s have a
special on today. A double chocolate sundae with
pineapple and nuts, cherry and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m saving my dollar for the
essentials of life. I may need it for gasoline if I decide
to drive over to Corbin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; Louise asked alertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was over there today, covering the Kippenberg
wedding,&rdquo; Penny explained. &ldquo;Only it turned out
there was no ceremony. Grant Atherwald jilted his
bride, or was spirited away by persons unknown. He
was last seen near a lily pool in an isolated part of
the estate. I picked up a wedding ring lying on the
ground close by. And then as a climax Mrs. Kippenberg
hurled a plate at Salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker, what are you saying?&rdquo; Louise demanded.
&ldquo;It sounds like one of those two-reel thrillers
they show over at the Rialto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the evidence,&rdquo; Penny said, showing her
the white gold ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how you get into so much adventure,&rdquo;
Louise replied enviously as she studied the trinket.
&ldquo;Start at the beginning and tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invitation was very much to Penny&rsquo;s liking.
Perching herself on the highest porch step she recounted
her visit to the Kippenberg estate, painting
an especially romantic picture of the castle dwelling,
the moat, and the drawbridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to visit the place,&rdquo; Louise declared.
&ldquo;You have all the luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you with me if I ever get to go again,&rdquo;
promised Penny. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this careless farewell, she sprang to her
feet, and hastened on home.</p>
<p>The next morning while Mrs. Weems was preparing
breakfast, Penny ran down to the corner to buy
the first edition of the <i>Star</i>. As she spread it open a
small headline accosted her eye.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;NO TRACE OF MISSING BRIDEGROOM.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny read swiftly, learning that Grant Atherwald
had not been seen since his strange disappearance
from the Kippenberg estate. Members of the family
refused to discuss the affair and had made no report
to the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This story is developing into something big after
all,&rdquo; she thought with quickening pulse. &ldquo;Now if Dad
will only let me work on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At home she gave the newspaper to her father, remarking
rather pointedly: &ldquo;You see, your expert reporters
haven&rsquo;t learned very much more than I
brought in yesterday. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good
idea to send me out there again today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I doubt if you could get into the estate,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Salt and I managed yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did very well, but you weren&rsquo;t known then.
It will be a different matter today since we antagonized
the family by using the story. I&rsquo;ll suggest that
Jerry Livingston be assigned to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Penny as first assistant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t
your type of story. Now if you would like to cover
a lecture at the Women&rsquo;s Club&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a nice peppy meeting of the Ladies Sewing
Circle,&rdquo; Penny finished ironically. &ldquo;Thank you, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance of getting
into the estate,&rdquo; her father said lamely. &ldquo;We must
have good coverage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Jerry have that I haven&rsquo;t got?&rdquo; Penny
demanded in an aggrieved voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight years of experience for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I really should go out there,&rdquo; Penny insisted.
&ldquo;I ought to show Miss Kippenberg the ring I found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring might provide an entry,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
admitted thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, why don&rsquo;t you
telephone long distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m able to make an appointment, may I
help Jerry cover the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If Sylvia Kippenberg
talks with you we&rsquo;ll be able to use anything she
says.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same as on my way to the estate now,
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a triumphant laugh, Penny left the breakfast
table and hastened to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long distance,&rdquo; she said into the transmitter. &ldquo;The
Kippenberg estate at Corbin, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hovered anxiously near the telephone while she
waited for the connection to be made. Ten minutes
elapsed before the bell jingled several times. Eagerly,
she jerked down the receiver. She could hear a faint,
far-away voice saying, &ldquo;hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I speak with Sylvia Kippenberg?&rdquo; Penny requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parker at Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kippenberg is not at home,&rdquo; came the stiff
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me speak with Mrs. Kippenberg,&rdquo; Penny
said quickly. &ldquo;I have something very important to
tell her. Yesterday when I was at the estate I found
a ring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receiver had clicked at the other end of the
line. The connection was broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>A SOCIETY BAZAAR</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Penny,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker sympathetically,
&ldquo;wealthy people have a way of being inaccessible to
the press. They surround themselves with servants
who have been trained to allow no invasion of their
privacy. They erect barriers which aren&rsquo;t easily
broken down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could have reached Miss Kippenberg I
feel sure she would have wished to learn about the
ring,&rdquo; returned Penny. &ldquo;Oh, well, let Jerry cover
the story. I&rsquo;ve lost interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that morning the girl went about the house in
a mood of deep depression. She felt completely out
of sorts and would scowl at her own reflection whenever
she passed a mirror. Nothing seemed to go right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, I wish you would forget that silly wedding,&rdquo;
Mrs. Weems said wearily. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
try working out your resentment on a tennis ball?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; admitted Penny. &ldquo;Only I have
no partner. Louise is going away somewhere today to
a charity bazaar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in Riverview?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Weems with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s to be held at Andover, twenty miles from
Corbin. Louise is going with an aunt of hers. She
invited me several days ago, but I didn&rsquo;t think it would
be any fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might enjoy it. Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it isn&rsquo;t too late?&rdquo; Penny glanced at
the clock.</p>
<p>A telephone call to the Sidell home assured her
that she would have ample time to get ready for the
trip. She quickly dressed and was waiting when Louise
and her aunt, Miss Lucinda Frome, drove up to
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of an affair is it?&rdquo; Penny inquired as
they traveled toward the distant town.</p>
<p>Miss Frome explained that the bazaar was being
sponsored by members of the D.A.R. organization
and would be held at one of the fashionable clubs of
the city. As Miss Frome belonged to the Riverview
chapter she and her guests would have an entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to meeting a number of prominent
persons today,&rdquo; the woman declared. &ldquo;The
Andover chapter has a very exclusive membership.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Louise winked at Penny, for it was a source of
amusement to her that her aunt stood in awe of society
personages. Neither she nor her chum suffered
from social ambition or a feeling of inferiority.</p>
<p>At Andover, Miss Frome drove the car to the City
Club and parked it beside a long row of other automobiles,
many of which were under the charge of
uniformed chauffeurs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; remarked Miss Frome nervously, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t realize how shabby my old coupe looks. I do
hope no one notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t start that, Aunty,&rdquo; Louise said, taking
her by the arm. &ldquo;Your car is perfectly all right. And
so are you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up the steps of the stone building and
mingled with the other women. So many persons
were present that the three newcomers attracted no
attention. Miss Frome was reassured to see that she
was as well dressed as anyone in the room.</p>
<p>Several long tables were covered with various articles
offered for sale. Penny and Louise wandered
about examining objects which struck their fancy.
Miss Frome bought a vase and an imitation ivory
elephant, but the girls considered the prices too high
for their purses.</p>
<p>Presently, Penny&rsquo;s gaze was drawn to a young
woman who stood behind one of the tables at the far
end of the room. She stopped short and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See someone you know?&rdquo; inquired Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that young woman with the dark hair and
the lace dress, Louise! She is Sylvia Kippenberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? I must say she has courage to come here
today after all that happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman did not realize that she was being
subjected to scrutiny. However, she seemed fully
aware that she was a general object of curiosity, for
her lips were frozen in a set smile and her face was
pale despite the rouge on the smooth cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she must be on the bazaar committee,&rdquo;
Louise went on. &ldquo;But my, if anyone had jilted me,
I would not have come here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry must have missed his interview after all,&rdquo;
Penny murmured, half to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad assigned him to the Kippenberg story.
I suppose he drove to Corbin today in the hope of
seeing Miss Sylvia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she may have come here just to escape reporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two cents I&rsquo;d try to interview her myself,&rdquo;
Penny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she would talk with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if she realizes I am a reporter. But at least I
can try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t create a scene whatever you do,&rdquo; Louise
warned uneasily. &ldquo;Not that I would mind. But Aunt
Lucinda would die of mortification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be careful,&rdquo; Penny promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>She sauntered forward, gradually working toward
the table where the young woman served. Selecting
an article at random from the display, she inquired
its price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg answered mechanically.</p>
<p>Penny loitered at the table until two elderly women
had moved on. She was now alone with Sylvia Kippenberg.
She would have no better opportunity to
speak with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kippenberg,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; The young woman really gazed at the girl
for the first time. Penny saw that her eyelids were red
and swollen from recent tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to talk with you alone, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know your name?&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg asked
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parker&mdash;Parker,&rdquo; the young woman repeated and
her eyes hardened. &ldquo;Oh, yes, you are the girl who
came to our place yesterday with that photographer!
And you telephoned again this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Penny admitted reluctantly, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman did not allow her to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not talk with you or any other reporter. You
have no right to come here and annoy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m not really a reporter, Miss Kippenberg.
I have something to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Miss Kippenberg had closed her ears to Penny&rsquo;s
words. She turned abruptly and fled in the direction
of the powder room.</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, remembering her promise to create
no scene. Still, she could not allow Miss Kippenberg
to elude her so easily. Determinedly, she followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss Kippenberg, you must listen to me,&rdquo;
she pleaded.</p>
<p>Observing that her words had not the slightest
effect upon the girl, she suddenly opened her purse
and took out the white gold ring. She thrust it in
front of Miss Kippenberg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish to show you this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman stopped short, gazing down at
the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; she asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do recognize it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Grant showed it to me the night before
we were to have been married. Tell me, how did it
come into your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg glanced quickly about and observing
that many eyes were focused upon them, led
the girl into the deserted powder room. They sat
down on a sofa in a secluded corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be so rude before,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg
apologized. &ldquo;It was only because I must protect
myself from reporters and photographers. You have
no idea how I have been annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;and I wish to help
you. That was why I was so insistent upon talking
with you. I think this ring may be a clue to Mr.
Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe as I do that he did not go away
purposely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory is that Mr. Atherwald was a victim of
a plot. Did he have any known enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, everyone liked Grant. Tell me about the
ring. Who gave it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one. I found it while I was exploring a path
on the estate, the trail which is blocked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have gone there, but no matter.
Just where did you pick up the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it near the lily pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg stared at Penny with expressionless,
half-glazed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured. Her head dropped low, her
body sagged and she slumped down on the sofa in a
faint.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>A THROWN STONE</i></h2>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s first thought was to call for assistance,
but sober reflection made her realize that to do so
would likely result in awkward questions. She felt
certain Miss Kippenberg had only fainted and would
soon revive.</p>
<p>Stretching the young woman full length upon the
sofa, the girl ran to the washroom for a glass of water.
She dampened a towel and folded it across Miss
Kippenberg&rsquo;s forehead, at the same time rubbing the
limp hands and trying to restore circulation. Noticing
the white gold ring which had fallen to the floor, she
reached down and picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kippenberg must have fainted because of
what I told her about the lily pond,&rdquo; thought Penny.
&ldquo;I should have used more tact.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>She watched the young woman anxiously, fearing
that what she had assumed to be an ordinary faint
might really be a heart attack. A wave of relief
surged over her as Miss Kippenberg stirred slightly.
Her long dark eyelashes fluttered open and she stared
blankly about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she asked, moistening her dry lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, drink this,&rdquo; Penny urged, offering the glass
of water. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel much better in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I remember,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg murmured.
&ldquo;You were saying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about that now. Just lie still and relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg did not try to speak again for
some little time. Then, despite Penny&rsquo;s protests, she
raised herself to a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel quite all right now,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;How
stupid of me to faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I was very tactless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, our conversation had nothing to
do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the heat,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg insisted. &ldquo;I had
a sunstroke once and since then I can&rsquo;t bear even an
overheated room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it really isn&rsquo;t very warm in here,&rdquo; protested
Penny. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t notice it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might not but I am very sensitive to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad your faint wasn&rsquo;t caused by anything
I said,&rdquo; Penny declared, although she continued
to regard the young woman dubiously. &ldquo;I thought
you seemed shocked by what I told you about the
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying that you picked it up near the
lily pond?&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg questioned in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Penny, watching her closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew the exact place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could go to your estate together I could
show you,&rdquo; Penny said eagerly.</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg hesitated in her reply, obviously
still prejudiced against the girl because of her connection
with the <i>Riverview Star</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;Will you please ask that
my car be sent to the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; said Penny, trying not to show her jubilance.</p>
<p>Leaving Miss Kippenberg in the powder room she
returned to the main hall. Louise separated from the
crowd and hurried to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, I saw you go off with Miss Kippenberg,&rdquo;
she began. &ldquo;Would she talk with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; answered Penny, &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;m going
with her to the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Aunt Lucinda expects to start home in a few
minutes,&rdquo; protested Louise. &ldquo;How long will you be
gone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. If I&rsquo;m not back here
by the time you are ready to leave don&rsquo;t wait for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you get home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll find a way. The important thing now is
to learn everything I can from Miss Kippenberg. She&rsquo;s
in a mood to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to visit the estate,&rdquo; Louise said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take you,&rdquo; Penny told her sincerely,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see how I can this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Penny. It would be very foolish
of you to try. You might lose your own chance to
gain an exclusive news story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you explain to your aunt about my sudden
disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;ll understand,&rdquo; Louise replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
wait here for you at least an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny left a call for Miss Kippenberg&rsquo;s car and
then went back to the powder room. The young
woman walked a bit unsteadily even with aid. However,
no one paid attention to them as they crossed
the main hall and made their way to the waiting automobile.</p>
<p>With Penny and Miss Kippenberg as passengers
the big limousine rolled away from the clubhouse
and sped toward Corbin. During the ride the young
woman scarcely spoke. She sat with her head against
the cushion, eyes half closed. As they came within
view of the drawbridge she made an effort to arouse
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have visitors at the estate,&rdquo; Penny commented,
noticing a number of cars parked near the
river&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporters, always reporters,&rdquo; returned Miss Kippenberg
impatiently. &ldquo;They may try to board as we
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny wondered how the limousine would be
taken across the river. The old watchman had noted
their approach. Before the car reached the end of the
road he had lowered the creaking drawbridge into
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the bridge really safe?&rdquo; Penny inquired of her
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For light traffic only,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg answered
briefly.</p>
<p>The arrival of the car had created a stir of interest
among the group of men gathered near the bridge.
Penny caught sight of Jerry Livingston and could not
resist rolling down the side window so he would be
sure to obtain a clear view of her. It gave her a very
pleasant feeling to see him stare as if he could not
believe his own eyes.</p>
<p>Several of the reporters attempted to stop the limousine
but without success. The car clattered over
the drawbridge which was pulled up again before
anyone could follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Penny and Miss Kippenberg alighted at the front
door of the great house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now show me where you found the ring,&rdquo; requested
the young woman.</p>
<p>Penny led her down the winding path into the
grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t meet your head gardener,&rdquo; she
said significantly. &ldquo;He seems to be such an unpleasant
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg glanced at her queerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yesterday he ordered me away from here in
no uncertain terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He only meant to do his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the man has been ordered to keep persons
away from this part of the estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg answered
aloofly. &ldquo;Mother has charge of the servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the man been in your employ long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that either.&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg&rsquo;s
voice warned Penny that she did not care to be questioned.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the old gardener as they came
presently to the lily pool. Penny searched about in
the grass for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where I found the ring,&rdquo; she revealed.
&ldquo;And see this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg drew in her breath
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem so remarkable.&rdquo; The young
woman bent to examine them. &ldquo;They probably were
made by Grant&rsquo;s own shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it looks as if there might have been a struggle
here,&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;From those marks wouldn&rsquo;t
you say a body had been dragged across the ground
toward the pool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Miss Kippenberg. &ldquo;The grass is trampled,
but I can&rsquo;t believe Grant has met with violence.
I refuse to think of such a thing! The pool&mdash;&rdquo; she
broke off and a shudder wracked her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is best to know the truth. Have you notified
the police about Mr. Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg shook her head. &ldquo;Until today I
thought he would return. Or at least I hoped so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me an expert should be called into the
case,&rdquo; Penny urged. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you telephone the
police station now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Sylvia looking very miserable.
&ldquo;Not without consulting Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s talk with her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t at home this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But something should be done, and at once,&rdquo;
Penny protested. &ldquo;The first rain will destroy all these
footprints and perhaps other important evidence. Do
you really love Grant Atherwald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; answered the young woman
soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should think you would have some interest
in what became of him. I can&rsquo;t understand your attitude
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have others to think of besides myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Sylvia avoided Penny&rsquo;s penetrating gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely your mother wouldn&rsquo;t wish an act of violence
to go unpunished. So much time has been lost
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t certain anything has happened to
Grant,&rdquo; Sylvia responded, her eyes downcast. &ldquo;If we
should bring the police into the case, and then it turns
out that he has merely gone away to some other city,
I&rsquo;d be held up to ridicule once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you are taking a most foolish attitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another reason why we must be very
careful,&rdquo; Sylvia said unwillingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For just an instant Penny dared hope that the young
woman meant to answer the question. But Sylvia
seemed to reconsider for she said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. Please don&rsquo;t ask me any more
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid you may be blamed for Mr. Atherwald&rsquo;s
disappearance?&rdquo; Penny persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I assure you I am not thinking of myself.
Please, let&rsquo;s return to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny deliberately blocked the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you wish me to notify the police there is
a little matter which I must ask you to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching down she picked up a small stone and
hurled it into the lily pond. As the ripples died away
they both observed a convulsive movement of the
water, a churning which had no relation to the missile
thrown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Penny evenly, &ldquo;that you understand
my meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</i></h2>
<p>Miss Kippenberg watched the concentric circles
race each other to the far edge of the lily pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know the reason why this part of the
estate is kept closed off?&rdquo; she murmured, very low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned about the alligator yesterday,&rdquo; said
Penny. &ldquo;Why is such an ugly brute kept here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was none of my doing, I assure you. I hate the
horrid thing. Surely you don&rsquo;t mean to suggest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not suggesting anything yet,&rdquo; said Penny
quietly. &ldquo;But you must realize that it is rather unusual
to keep an alligator on one&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father brought it here from Florida,&rdquo; Miss
Kippenberg revealed reluctantly. &ldquo;For some reason
the creature seemed to fascinate him. He insisted upon
keeping it in the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is not living here now I am told.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg quickly switched
the subject back to the alligator. &ldquo;Mother and I
would like to get rid of the beast but we&rsquo;ve never
been able to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any zoo should be willing to take it off your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother often spoke of getting in touch with one
but for some reason she never did. I suppose she hesitated
to give the alligator away upon Father&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny remained silent, wondering how deeply she
dared probe into the private life of the Kippenberg
family. After all there were certain inquiries which
a person of sensibility could not make. She couldn&rsquo;t
very well ask: &ldquo;Have your parents separated? Why
did your father leave home? Is it true he is wanted by
the authorities for evading income tax?&rdquo; although
these questions were upon the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>She did say carelessly, &ldquo;Your father is away, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg answered briefly. After a
moment she went on: &ldquo;Father was rather peculiar in
many ways. He had a decided flare for the unusual.
Take this estate for instance. He had it built at great
expense to resemble a castle he once saw in Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never visited such an elegant place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is entirely too flamboyant for my taste. But
Father loved every tower and turret. If only things
had turned out different&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Her voice trailed away and she stared at the ground,
lost in deep thought. Arousing herself, she went on
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had known Father you would understand
it was not strange for him to have an alligator on the
estate. At one time he kept imported peacocks. The
place was fairly overrun with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny offered no comment. She moved closer to
the edge of the lily pool, gazing down into the now
tranquil waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are trying to imply,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg
said jerkily. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be possible. I refuse
even to consider such a ridiculous theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem rather far-fetched,&rdquo; Penny admitted.
&ldquo;Of course, tragedies do occur and those foot-prints&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, not another word or you&rsquo;ll drive me into
hysterics!&rdquo; Sylvia cried. &ldquo;You are trying to play upon
my feelings so that I will tell you things! You are
only trying to get a story! I&rsquo;ll not talk with you any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and ran up the path toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overplayed my hand that time,&rdquo; thought Penny
ruefully. &ldquo;As Dad says, I really have too much imagination
to make a good reporter. Also too lively a
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kippenberg had vanished into the house by
the time the girl retraced her way to the garden. The
black limousine no longer stood at the front door so
she knew she was expected to get back to Andover
by her own efforts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Jerry is still waiting at the drawbridge, I&rsquo;ll ride
home with him,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Otherwise, I&rsquo;m
out of luck completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path which Penny followed brought her toward
the rear of the house. As she drew near, the
kitchen door suddenly opened and a stout woman in
a blue uniform came outside. In her arms she carried
two large paper sacks which appeared to be filled with
garbage for the bottoms were moist.</p>
<p>Just as the woman reached Penny one of the bags
gave away, allowing a collection of corn husks,
watermelon rinds and egg shells to fall on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo; she exclaimed crossly. &ldquo;Splattered
my stockings too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Penny, pausing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the only place I ever worked where the
cook was expected to carry out the garbage!&rdquo; the
woman complained. &ldquo;It makes me good and mad
every time I do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think a house of this size would have an
incinerator so that the garbage could be burned,&rdquo;
Penny remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this place doesn&rsquo;t have any conveniences for
the servants,&rdquo; the cook went on. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re expected to
work, work, work from morning to night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>She broke off quickly, regarding Penny with a
suspicious gaze. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one of Miss Sylvia&rsquo;s
guests?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I only came here on an errand. I wouldn&rsquo;t
repeat anything to the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right then,&rdquo; the woman said in relief.
&ldquo;I liked my job here well enough until lately. All
month it&rsquo;s been one dinner party after another. Then
we spent days getting ready for the wedding feast
and not one scrap of food was touched!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I suppose Mrs. Kippenberg pays you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, she didn&rsquo;t give me one extra cent for all
the work I did. Mrs. Kippenberg always has been real
close, and she&rsquo;s a heap worse since her husband went
away. Another week like this last one and I quit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say I blame you,&rdquo; Penny said, leading
the woman on. &ldquo;I suppose Miss Sylvia is as overbearing
as her mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Sylvia is all right, as sweet a girl as you&rsquo;ll
find anywhere. I felt mighty sorry for her when that
no-account man threw her over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew by this time that she must be talking
with Mrs. Latch, for the footman had mentioned the
cook&rsquo;s name. As the woman walked on with her bundles
of garbage she fell into step with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was strange about Mr. Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo;
she remarked. &ldquo;I hear he came to the house and
then went away just before the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you about that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Latch with
an important air. &ldquo;Yesterday morning a boy came to
the back door with a letter for Mr. Atherwald. It&rsquo;s
my opinion he sent it to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the boy tell you where he had obtained the
letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was given to him by one of Mr. Atherwald&rsquo;s
friends. A man in a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Penny, making a mental note of
the information. Realizing that the cook had told
everything she knew about the matter, she quickly
switched the subject. &ldquo;By the way, who is the head
gardener here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Peter Henderson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fairly old man,&rdquo; described Penny. &ldquo;Gray hair,
stooped shoulders, and I might add, an unpleasant
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s Peter. He&rsquo;s not much of a gardener
in my opinion. And he feels too high and mighty to
associate with the other servants. He doesn&rsquo;t even stay
here nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a new man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kippenberg hired him only three days before
the wedding. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s done a lick of honest
work since he came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Kippenberg doesn&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been too busy and bothered to pay any attention
to him,&rdquo; the cook declared. &ldquo;But she always
has time to boss me. I tell you, if dishes aren&rsquo;t prepared
perfectly she raves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder Mr. Kippenberg was forced to leave
home,&rdquo; Penny interposed slyly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame
him for running away from a violent temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Kippenbergs never had any trouble,&rdquo; Mrs.
Latch corrected. &ldquo;Mr. Kippenberg would just laugh
and not say a word when she jumped on him. They
were never heard to quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it seems odd that he went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; agreed the cook, frowning. &ldquo;I never
did understand it. And then the way Mrs. Kippenberg
changed all the servants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean after Mr. Kippenberg went away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She fired everyone except me. I guess she knew
she couldn&rsquo;t get another cook half as good if she let
me go. Right away I struck for more money and she
gave it to me without a whimper. But since then she
works me like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Latch clattered the lid of the garbage can into
place and turned toward the house. But as Penny once
more fell into step with her, she paused and regarded
the girl with sudden suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, why am I telling you all this anyway? Who
are you? You&rsquo;re not one of those sneaking reporters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a reporter?&rdquo; countered Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Latch. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;re as inquisitive as one. You must be the girl who
brought Miss Sylvia&rsquo;s new dress from the LaRue
Shoppe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hesitated too long over her reply, and the
woman gazed at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a reporter!&rdquo; she exclaimed with conviction.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been deliberately pumping me! Of
all the tricks! I&rsquo;ll tell Miss Kippenberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, I can explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Latch paid no heed. With an angry toss of
her head she hastened into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overstepped myself again,&rdquo; Penny thought in dismay.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be getting away from here while the getting
is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning, she ran down the walk toward the river,
only to stop short as she reached the boat dock. The
drawbridge was in open position and the old watchman
did not appear to be at his usual post. She had
no way of reaching the mainland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>FISHERMAN&rsquo;S LUCK</i></h2>
<p>Penny looked anxiously about for a means of
crossing the river. There were no small boats available
and the only person who stood on the opposite shore
was Jerry Livingston. The other reporters and photographers,
evidently tiring of their long vigil, had
gone away.</p>
<p>She cupped her hands and shouted to Jerry: &ldquo;How
am I going to get over there? Can you lower the
bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mechanism is locked,&rdquo; called back the reporter.
&ldquo;And the watchman won&rsquo;t be back for an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny walked a short distance up the shore searching
for a boat. The only available craft was the large
launch which she could not hope to operate. She
might return to the house and appeal to Miss Kippenberg
but such a course was not to her liking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>As she considered whether or not to ruin her clothing
by swimming across, Jerry called her attention to
a small boat some distance up the river. The boy who
was fishing from it obligingly rowed ashore after
Penny had signaled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you fifty cents to ferry me across,&rdquo; she
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>Penny stepped into the boat and then asked:
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the same lad I saw here yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded as he reached for the oars. &ldquo;I remember
you,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to fish here nearly every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about. I caught some nice ones today.&rdquo;
Proudly he held up two large fish for her to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauties,&rdquo; praised Penny. &ldquo;I take it the motor
boats haven&rsquo;t been bothering you as much as they
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been pretty quiet on the river today,&rdquo; the boy
agreed. &ldquo;Want to see something else I fished up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. What did you hook, a mud turtle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy opened a large wooden box which contained
an assortment of rope, fishing tackle and miscellaneous
articles. He lifted out a man&rsquo;s high silk hat,
bedraggled and shapeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fished that out of the water?&rdquo; Penny demanded,
leaning forward to take the article from him.
&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Up there a ways.&rdquo; The boy motioned vaguely
toward a point on the Kippenberg estate.</p>
<p>Penny turned the hat over in her hand, examining
it closely. She found no identifying marks, yet she
believed that it had belonged to Grant Atherwald for
he had worn similar headdress. The point indicated
by the boy was not far distant from the Kippenberg
lily pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to sell this hat?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not worth anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have it,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
another fifty cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny offered the boy a dollar bill, and a moment
later he beached the boat. Jerry was waiting to help
her ashore. His alert gaze fastened upon the hat which
she hugged close, but he withheld comment. To the
boy he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, how would you like to earn five dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes brightened. &ldquo;Say, this is my lucky
day!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; Jerry told him. &ldquo;All you need to do
is to be here for a couple of days with your boat.
You&rsquo;re not to allow anyone to use it except me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; added Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need taxi service myself
if I come back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; agreed the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a dollar on deposit,&rdquo; Jerry said. &ldquo;Now remember,
be here tomorrow from eight o&rsquo;clock on,
and don&rsquo;t hire out to any other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the boy promised.</p>
<p>Jerry took Penny&rsquo;s elbow and escorted her to the
press car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you found Atherwald&rsquo;s hat?&rdquo; he asked without
preliminaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It resembles the one he wore. The boy fished it
out of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that looks as if the fellow really was the
victim of a plot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought so all along,&rdquo; Penny declared soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did you learn? You seemed to be very
chummy with Miss Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be from now on,&rdquo; Penny returned ruefully.</p>
<p>As Jerry backed the car around in the dusty road,
she told of her meeting with Sylvia Kippenberg and
the ensuing conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Miss Kippenberg doesn&rsquo;t like questions?&rdquo; Jerry
asked. &ldquo;And she refuses to notify the police? Well,
after we publish our story in the <i>Star</i> it won&rsquo;t be
necessary. The police will come to do their own investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really believe she is trying to deceive the
authorities,&rdquo; Penny said thoughtfully. &ldquo;She seems to
have a sincere regard for Grant Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be pretense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t pretending the day of the wedding.
Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance was a great shock to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, even so, she may know a lot more than
she&rsquo;s putting out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that myself. She closed up like a clam
when I talked about her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car came to the main road and a short time
later entered the town of Corbin. As they stopped for
a red light, Penny touched Jerry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over there,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;See those two
men standing in front of the drugstore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re G men who attended the Kippenberg
wedding. Salt pointed them out to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Maybe we can learn a fact or two
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry parked the car at the curb and sprang out.
Penny saw him walk over to the men, introduce himself
and show his press credentials. She was too far
away to hear the conversation.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Jerry returned to the car looking
none too elated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t learn anything, did you?&rdquo; Penny inquired
as they drove on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much. Government men never will talk.
But they did admit they were here trying to locate
James Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then they think he is in the locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had an idea he would show up at his daughter&rsquo;s
wedding. But it didn&rsquo;t turn out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say anything to them about Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s
disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they wouldn&rsquo;t discuss it. They said they
had nothing to do with the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lapsed into reflective silence as the car went
on toward Andover. Mentally she sorted over the
evidence which she had gathered that day, trying to
fit it into a definite pattern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably laugh at this, but I have a theory
about Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, spill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday when Salt and I were waiting at the
drawbridge we saw a motorboat cruise down the
river. It was driven by a burly looking fellow who
paid no heed when we tried to hail him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not suggesting that the man may have had
something to do with Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;
Jerry questioned, mildly amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory sounds pretty far-fetched to me, I&rsquo;ll
admit. It happens there are any number of burly,
tough looking boatmen on the Kobalt. You can&rsquo;t arrest
a man for a crime just because of his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, there is supporting evidence. Mrs.
Latch told me that Atherwald&rsquo;s note had been handed
to her by a boy who in turn received it from someone
in a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boats are rather common too. Your theory is interesting,
but that&rsquo;s all I can say for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I was about to tell you
another idea of mine. Now I won&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No amount of coaxing could induce her to reveal
her thought, and the remainder of the drive to
Andover was made in silence. It was well after five-thirty
when the car finally drew up in front of the
City Club.</p>
<p>Penny was not surprised to find the doors locked
and no sign of Louise or Miss Frome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they would go home without me,&rdquo; she
said to Jerry. &ldquo;I only wanted to make certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many miles the road led through pleasant
countryside and then swung back toward the Kobalt
river. The sun had dropped below the horizon by the
time the automobile sped through the town of Claxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty miles still to go,&rdquo; Jerry sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two souls with but a single thought,&rdquo; remarked
Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Directly ahead they noticed an electric sign which
drew attention to a roadside gasoline station with an
adjoining restaurant. Jerry eased on the brake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Penny? Shall we invest a few
nickels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do with a sandwich,&rdquo; Penny agreed.
&ldquo;Several, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until Jerry had parked the car did they notice
the dilapidated condition of the building. It stood
perhaps fifty yards back from the main road, its rear
porch fronting on the Kobalt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange how one is always running into the river,&rdquo;
Penny remarked absently. &ldquo;It seems to twist itself over
half the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had not heard her words. He was gazing at
the restaurant with disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place doesn&rsquo;t look so good, Penny. If you
say the word we&rsquo;ll drive on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d brave anything for a beef barbecue,&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>
<p>Through the screen door they caught a discouraging
glimpse of the cafe&rsquo;s interior&mdash;dingy walls, cigarette
smoke, a group of rough looking men seated on
stools at the counter. Upon the threshold Penny
hesitated, losing courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not go in,&rdquo; Jerry grunted in an undertone.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably serve cockroaches in the sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Penny half turned away from the door only to stop
short. Her attention focused upon two men who were
sitting at the far end of the cafe drinking coffee from
heavy mugs. In the indistinct light she could not be
absolutely sure, yet she was instantly convinced that
the heavy-set fellow in shirt sleeves was the same
boatman who had been seen near the Kippenberg
estate.</p>
<p>To Jerry&rsquo;s surprise, Penny resisted the tug of his
arm as he sought to lead her toward the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place isn&rsquo;t half bad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it
and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boldly she reached for the knob of the screen door
and entered the cafe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>TWO MEN AND A BOAT</i></h2>
<p>Penny ignored several empty tables at the front
of the dreary restaurant and selected one not far from
where the two men sat. As they glanced at her with
insolent, appraising eyes, her pulse quickened. She
was almost certain that the heavy-set man was the
same fellow she had noticed near the Kippenberg
estate.</p>
<p>A waiter in a soiled white apron shuffled up to take
their order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot roast beef sandwich and coffee,&rdquo; said Jerry.
&ldquo;With plenty of cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make mine the same,&rdquo; added Penny without looking
at the menu.</p>
<p>All her attention centered upon the two men who
were now talking together in low tones. After the
first glance they had taken no interest in her and were
unaware of her scrutiny. The heavy-set man bent
nearer his companion and with the point of his knife
drew a pattern on the tablecloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of this route, Joe?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too risky,&rdquo; the other muttered. &ldquo;Once we start
we got to make a quick shoot to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way we take we might run into trouble.
Y&rsquo;know, I wish we had never agreed to do the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and me both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietz ain&rsquo;t to be trusted,&rdquo; the heavy-set man said
and his shaggy eyebrows drew together in a scowl.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking first and last of his own skin. We&rsquo;ve
got to watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl, too. She&rsquo;s a dumb one and plenty apt
to talk if the going gets rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny lost the remainder of the conversation as
Jerry spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have picked a worse place,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;Look at all the breakfast egg on the tablecloth.
I&rsquo;m in favor of walking out even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; replied Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s got into you anyway?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting mighty funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice those two men at the last table,&rdquo; she indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that heavy-set fellow with the tattooed anchor
on his arm? Well, I&rsquo;m satisfied he is the same boatman
who cruised near the Kippenberg estate yesterday
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; Jerry agreed, unimpressed. &ldquo;The
Kobalt is only a stone&rsquo;s throw away. And this place
seems to be frequented by rivermen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear what they were saying?&rdquo; whispered
Penny. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry immediately fell silent, centering his attention
upon the two men. But by this time they had
lowered their voices so that only an occasional word
could be distinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were they saying anyway?&rdquo; Jerry asked
curiously.</p>
<p>Before Penny could answer, the proprietor came
from the kitchen bearing two plates of food which he
set down before them. The sandwiches were covered
with a dark brown, watery gravy, potatoes bore a
heavy coating of grease and the coffee looked weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; the man inquired indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Jerry replied, with emphasis. &ldquo;In fact,
it&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the adjoining table the two men abruptly hauled
to their feet. Paying their bill they quitted the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave, too,&rdquo; suggested Penny. &ldquo;I should like
to see where they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry pushed his plate aside. &ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;Even my cast-iron stomach can&rsquo;t wrestle with such
food as this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>He paid at the cash register and they went out into
the night. Penny looked about for the two men and
saw them walking toward the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Jerry as she started to follow.
&ldquo;Tell me what all the excitement is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tersely, Penny repeated the conversation she had
overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tough looking hombres all right,&rdquo; Jerry
admitted. &ldquo;Likely as not mixed up in some dirty business.
But to say they&rsquo;re involved in the Kippenberg
affair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry,&rdquo; Penny broke in impatiently, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
never learn anything if we take that attitude. We must
run down every possible clue. Please, let&rsquo;s see if they
go down to the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be getting our story back to the
office,&rdquo; Jerry reminded her. &ldquo;If we miss the last edition
there will be fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only take a minute,&rdquo; Penny insisted stubbornly.
&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t come with me, then I&rsquo;m going
alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started away and the reporter had no choice
but to follow. A narrow, well-trod path led down a
steep slope toward the river. Long before they came
within sight of it they could hear the croak of bullfrogs
and feel the damp, night mists enveloping them
like a cloak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Drawing closer to the two men, Penny and Jerry
slackened pace and moved with greater care. But if
they hoped to learn anything from the conversation
of the pair ahead they were disappointed. The talk
concerned only the weather.</p>
<p>Reaching the banks of the river, the two men
boarded a sturdy cabin cruiser which had been moored
to a sagging dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very same boat,&rdquo; Penny whispered jubilantly.
&ldquo;I knew I wasn&rsquo;t mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, what does that prove?&rdquo; demanded Jerry.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no crime to run a motorboat near the Kippenberg
estate. The river is free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must admit there <i>is</i> other evidence. Oh,
why can&rsquo;t we follow them? We might learn something
really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going off on any wild chase tonight,&rdquo;
stated Jerry sternly. &ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s home for us before
your father sends a police squad to search for
his missing daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing a golden opportunity, Jerry Livingston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, by the time we located a boat those men
would be ten miles from here. They&rsquo;re leaving now.
Use your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Penny gave in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go home, but
I&rsquo;ll bet a cent you&rsquo;ll be sorry later on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>She waited until the cruiser was lost to view in the
darkness and then allowed the reporter to guide her
back up the steep path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least let&rsquo;s try to find out who the men are,&rdquo;
Penny urged as they came near the cafe. &ldquo;The restaurant
owner might know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More to please her than for any other reason, Jerry
said that he would inquire. He re-entered the cafe, returning
in a few minutes to report that the proprietor
had never seen either of the men before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let&rsquo;s be traveling,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
killed enough time here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the remainder of the ride back to Riverview,
Penny had little to say. But long after she knew Jerry
had forgotten the two boatmen she kept turning their
conversation over in her mind. She only wished she
might prove that her theories were not ridiculous.</p>
<p>Presently, the automobile drew up in front of the
Parker residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in, Jerry?&rdquo; Penny invited. &ldquo;Dad
may wish to talk with you about the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might stop a minute. I have a question or two to
ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the house swung open as Penny and
the reporter crossed the front porch. Anthony Parker
stood framed in the bright electric light, a tall, imposing
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home safe,&rdquo; he said, not trying to
hide his relief. &ldquo;Mrs. Weems and I have both been
worried. It&rsquo;s going on nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late? Didn&rsquo;t Louise telephone you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she said you had gone on to the Kippenberg
estate. Knowing you, I worried all the more. What
mischief did you get into this time, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. Jerry took care of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker held the door open for his daughter and
Jerry to pass through. &ldquo;Have you had your dinners?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stopped at a roadside cafe, Dad. But the food
was horrible. We didn&rsquo;t even try to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems can find something for you, I&rsquo;m sure.
She&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call her just yet,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;First, we
want to tell you what we&rsquo;ve learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker listened attentively as Penny gave a detailed
account of her visit to the estate, the finding
of the silk hat, and finally of her encounter with the
two boatmen at the river cafe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have learned a lot more if only Jerry hadn&rsquo;t
played grandmother,&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;He refused
to follow the boat down the river&mdash;said it would only
be a wild chase.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, I&rsquo;m glad you had will power enough to
overrule her,&rdquo; declared Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The possibility
of those men being connected with the Atherwald
case seems very vague to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you should have heard what they were saying!
The one man drew a design on the tablecloth and
asked his companion what he thought of the route.
They talked about a quick get-away to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men may have been fugitives,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
commented. &ldquo;But even that isn&rsquo;t very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spoke of being uneasy about a certain job
they had agreed to do,&rdquo; Penny went on earnestly.
&ldquo;They mentioned a girl and said that a fellow named
Dietz would bear watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker leaned forward in his chair. &ldquo;Dietz?&rdquo; he
questioned. &ldquo;Are you certain that was the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard it clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how there could be any connection,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker mused. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you hear the name before, Dad?&rdquo;
Penny asked, all eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, DeWitt has been digging up all the facts he
can about James Kippenberg. As it happens, the man
once had a business associate named Aaron Dietz who
was dismissed because of alleged dishonesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there must be a relationship!&rdquo; Penny cried.
She whirled triumphantly to face the crestfallen reporter.
&ldquo;You see, Mr. Jerry Livingston, my theory
wasn&rsquo;t so crazy after all! Now aren&rsquo;t you sorry?&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>THE STONE TOWER</i></h2>
<p>Louise Sidell was washing the breakfast dishes
when Penny walked boldly in at the back door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever answer doorbells, Lou?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;I stood around front for half an hour, ringing
and ringing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Penny. I didn&rsquo;t hear you at all,&rdquo;
apologized Louise. &ldquo;The radio is on too loud. I see you
reached home last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny picked up a towel and began to dry dishes.
&ldquo;Oh, yes, and did I have a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened after you left Andover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, so I&rsquo;ll begin at the end. Last
night, coming home with Jerry we stopped at a cafe
along the river. Guess whom we saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing your luck, I&rsquo;d say Charlie Chaplin, or
maybe the Queen of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This particular cafe wasn&rsquo;t quite their speed, Lou.
Jerry and I saw that same boatman I told you about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow you saw cruising about the Kippenberg
estate? What&rsquo;s so remarkable about that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It just happens I&rsquo;ve dug up other evidence to show
he may know something about Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo;
Penny revealed proudly. &ldquo;Jerry and I
overheard a conversation. It seems this man and a companion
of his are mixed up with another fellow named
Aaron Dietz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me,&rdquo; complained
Louise, scrubbing hard at a sticky plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaron Dietz was a former associate of James
Kippenberg. Dad said he probably knew more about
the Kippenberg financial affairs than any other person.
Oh, I tell you, Jerry feels pretty sick because we
didn&rsquo;t follow the men last night! Dad assigned him to
try to pick up the trail today. He&rsquo;s chartered a motor
boat and will patrol the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Louise patiently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to hear the first part of the story now. Then I
might know what this is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking as fast as she could, Penny related everything
which had happened since she had taken leave
of her chum at Andover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which brings me to the point of my visit,&rdquo; she
ended her tale. &ldquo;How about going out there with me
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Kippenberg estate?&rdquo; Louise asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we may not be able to get across the river,
but I mean to try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m wild to visit the place, Penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon can you start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as these stupid dishes are done. And I
ought to change my dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear something dark which won&rsquo;t attract attention
in the bushes,&rdquo; advised Penny. &ldquo;Now get to working
on yourself while I finish the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise dropped the dishcloth and hurried upstairs.
When she returned ten minutes later, her chum was
swishing the last of the soapsuds down the sink drain.
Another five minutes and they were in Penny&rsquo;s battered
car, speeding toward Corbin.</p>
<p>The sun rode high in the sky by the time they
came within view of the drawbridge. Noticing that a
press car from a rival newspaper was parked at the
end of the road, Penny drew up some distance away.
She could see two reporters talking with the old
watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently, they&rsquo;re having no luck in getting over
to the estate,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have our own private taxi service,&rdquo; Penny
chuckled. &ldquo;At least I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a circuitous route so they would not be
noticed by the bridgeman, the girls went down to the
river&rsquo;s edge. Far up the stream Penny saw the familiar
rowboat drifting with the current. At her signal the
small boy seized his oars and rowed toward shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was here at eight o&rsquo;clock just as you said,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;That fellow up there by the bridge offered
me a dollar to take him across the river. I turned him
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; approved Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go across the river now?&rdquo; the boy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo; Penny stepped into the boat and
made room for Louise. &ldquo;Keep close to the bank until
we are around the bend. Then I&rsquo;ll show you where to
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re afraid someone will see you,&rdquo; the
boy commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly afraid,&rdquo; corrected Penny. &ldquo;But this
way will be best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat moved quietly along the high bank, well
out of sight of those who stood by the drawbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cops were here this morning,&rdquo; volunteered the
boy as he pulled at the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw them visit the estate?&rdquo; Penny questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, there were four of &rsquo;em. They drove up in a
police car and they made old Thorndyke let the
bridge down so they could go across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the policemen at the estate now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they left again in about an hour. What do
you suppose they wanted over there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I couldn&rsquo;t guess,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;Like as not they only wished to ask a few questions.
Are the Kippenbergs at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Mrs. Kippenberg drive away right after the
police left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she must be still there. Anyway, she wasn&rsquo;t
in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat rounded the bend, and Penny pointed out
a place on the opposite shore where she wished to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait for you?&rdquo; the boy asked as the girls
stepped from the craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not here,&rdquo; directed Penny. &ldquo;You might
row back to the opposite shore and keep watch from
there. We ought to be ready to leave within at least an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roof top of the Kippenberg house could be seen
towering above the tall trees. But as the two girls
plunged into the bushes which grew thickly along
the shore they lost sight of it entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Louise uneasily, &ldquo;that you know
where you are going. It would be easy to lose one&rsquo;s
self in this jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have my directions straight. We should come
out near the lily pool at any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you hope to gain by coming here,
Penny?&rdquo; Louise inquired abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would try to talk with Miss Kippenberg
again. There&rsquo;s an important question I forgot to
ask her yesterday. Then I wanted to show you the
estate, especially the lily pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything unusual about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you be the judge,&rdquo; Penny answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
almost there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came in a moment to a path which made walking
much easier. Penny went in advance of her chum.
Suddenly she halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what is ahead, Lou! I never saw that thing
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped to one side so that Louise might see
the tall stone tower which loomed up against a background
of scarlet maples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How curious!&rdquo; murmured Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the only queer thing I&rsquo;ve found on the
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What purpose could the tower have?&rdquo; speculated
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decoration, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Penny, moving forward
again. &ldquo;Or it might have been built for a prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, you have too many different theories about
Grant Atherwald,&rdquo; laughed Louise. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
get one and stick to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind is always open to new possibilities and
impressions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it is,&rdquo; agreed Louise. &ldquo;I suppose you think
Mrs. Kippenberg is keeping young Atherwald a
prisoner in yonder tower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, but you must admit it would make a
lovely one. So romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to kid me?&rdquo; Louise demanded.</p>
<p>Penny smiled broadly as she stared up at the tower
which rose perhaps twelve feet. Like every other
building on the estate it had been built to resist the
ages. High above her head a circular window had
been cut in the wall and there was a heavy oaken door.</p>
<p>Reaching for the knob, Penny turned it. Then she
pressed her shoulder against the door and pushed with
her entire strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t learn what is inside after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will,&rdquo; declared Penny. &ldquo;You lift me up
and I&rsquo;ll peep in the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only weigh a ton,&rdquo; complained Louise.</p>
<p>She obligingly raised Penny up as high as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look fast,&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hold you forever,&rdquo; Louise said, and released
her hold. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see anything at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a lot of machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tools, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, an electric motor and something which looked
like it might be a pump. Oh, I get it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get what?&rdquo; demanded Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the idea of this tower. It must be used as a
pump house. I wondered how the lily pool was ever
drained and this must be the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see any prisoners chained inside?&rdquo;
Louise teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one. Well, let&rsquo;s be getting on to the lily pond.
It must be somewhere close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise could not understand why her chum was so
determined that she should see the pool. But since
Penny seldom did anything without a purpose, she
speculated upon what might be in store. She knew
from the girl&rsquo;s manner that certain facts had been withheld
deliberately to make this visit the more impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Penny as they came to the clearing.
&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise was aware of a deep sense of disappointment
as she gazed at the lily pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see anything so remarkable about it,
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the place where I found the wedding
ring. And there were footprints indicating that a
struggle probably took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read all that in the paper,&rdquo; Louise said. &ldquo;From
the hints you&rsquo;ve been passing out, I thought you
brought me here to show me something mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go close to the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for, Penny? You want to push me in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re too suspicious! Go on and look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise went to the edge of the pool and peered down
into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will in just a minute. Keep looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise was more than half convinced that Penny
meant to play some prank, but she dropped down on
her knees so her eyes would be closer to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I do see some large object on the floor of
the tank!&rdquo; she exclaimed after a moment. &ldquo;What is
it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An alligator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise gave a smothered scream and drew back from
the pool&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I might have fallen in. You ought to be ashamed
of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wanted you to get a nice thrill,&rdquo; Penny
grinned. &ldquo;Pretty fellow, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really see him,&rdquo; Louise admitted.</p>
<p>Overcoming her fear, she again leaned over the
edge of the pool but with great caution. This time she
could make out the alligator&rsquo;s form distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;I wish you hadn&rsquo;t
brought me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words ended in a little wail as a tiny object
splashed into the water directly beneath her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cameo pin!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, Penny, it slipped
from my dress and now it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>A CAMEO PIN</i></h2>
<p>In dismay, the two girls watched the trinket
settle slowly to the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my beautiful pin,&rdquo; moaned Louise. &ldquo;Aunt
Lucinda gave it to me for my birthday. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
lost it for anything in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was my fault,&rdquo; Penny said self-accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t. I must have been careless about
fastening the clasp. When I leaned over it slipped off.
Well, it&rsquo;s gone, and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cameo pin had fallen into the deepest part of
the pool not far from where the alligator lay. The
girls were unable to see it plainly because of the lily
pads and plants which cluttered the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that old alligator would just behave himself we
could wade in and get it easy,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy trying it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he would take special delight in snapping
off an arm or a leg. And we don&rsquo;t dare ask anyone
to help us get the pin or we&rsquo;ll be ejected from the
grounds as trespassers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well forget about it, Penny. Come
along, I&rsquo;m sick of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait, Louise. We might be able to fish it out
with a stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it will do no harm to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny searched the woods until she found a long
stick with a curve at the end. Lying flat on the flagstones
at the edge of the pool she prodded for the
pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can touch it all right!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull it over
to the side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful you don&rsquo;t tumble in,&rdquo; Louise warned,
anxiously holding her chum by the waist. &ldquo;If you
should lose your balance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hooked the cameo pin in the curve of the
stick and began raising it inch by inch up the side of
the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get it up high enough reach down and
snatch it,&rdquo; Penny advised her chum. &ldquo;Oh, shoot, there
it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pin had slipped away from the stick and
settled once more on the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get it, Penny,&rdquo; Louise insisted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
making the alligator all excited by prodding around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about <i>him</i>. I&rsquo;ll try once more if I can
locate the pin. It seems to be hiding from me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was so disturbed that Penny could not
see the pin or the bottom of the pool. She waited
several minutes for the dirt to settle and then gazed
down once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It moved over quite
a ways to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise flattened herself beside Penny. &ldquo;Oh, let the
pin go,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think I can get it. Say, there seems to be
something else on the bottom of the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pointed, and then, as her chum still could
not distinguish anything, parted the lily pads with
her stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do see something now,&rdquo; Louise declared.
&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like a metal ring?&rdquo; Penny asked.
She had lost all interest in the cameo pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does. Someone probably threw it into the
pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it looks to me as if it&rsquo;s attached to the bottom
of the tank, embedded in the cement,&rdquo; Penny said.
She bent closer to the water, trying to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Louise warned nervously. &ldquo;That alligator
might come up and snap off your nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paid no heed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is attached!&rdquo; she announced in an excited voice.
&ldquo;Louise, do you know what I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ring of a trapdoor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trapdoor!&rdquo; Louise echoed incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s an iron ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look a little like one from here,&rdquo; Louise
admitted. &ldquo;But whoever heard of a trapdoor in a lily
pool? No one but you would even think of such a
thing. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anything on this estate make sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring might have something to do with draining
the pool,&rdquo; Louise said without replying to her
chum&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;I suppose a section of the pool
could be lifted up and removed. But I&rsquo;d never call it
a trapdoor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could tell for sure what it is.&rdquo; Penny
tried to prod the ring with her stick but it was well
beyond her reach. &ldquo;Maybe the alligator has a room
down under the pool where he spends his winters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re simply filled with ideas today,&rdquo; Louise declared.
&ldquo;What about my pin? Shall we let it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reminded of her original task, Penny set to work
once more, trying to draw the cameo to the edge of
the tank. She was so deeply engrossed, that she jumped
as her chum touched her on the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Penny, I think someone is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>From the path at the right they could hear approaching
footsteps and the low murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Penny struggled to her feet, dropping the stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t be caught here,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Taking Louise&rsquo;s hand, she drew the girl into the
dense bushes directly behind the pool. Scarcely had
they secreted themselves when Sylvia Kippenberg
and the head gardener came into view. They seated
themselves on a rustic bench not far from where the
two girls stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to talk with you,&rdquo; Sylvia said to the old man.
&ldquo;The police came this morning and asked so many
questions. Mother put them off but they&rsquo;ll be back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t learn about the alligator?&rdquo; the gardener
asked gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they came here but only stayed a few minutes.
I don&rsquo;t think they noticed anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their investigation is only beginning,&rdquo; Sylvia said
nervously. &ldquo;Mother and I both believe it would be
wise to get rid of the alligator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise but not easy,&rdquo; the gardener replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see what you can do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll try to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I guess that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Sylvia said, but she made
no move to leave. She sat staring moodily at the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else on your mind?&rdquo; asked the gardener.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to ask you something, but I scarcely
know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener waited, watching the girl&rsquo;s face intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never liked Grant Atherwald,&rdquo; she began
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you driving at?&rdquo; the man asked
quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not trying to hint that I had anything
to do with Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two faced each other and Sylvia&rsquo;s gaze was the
first to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more about his disappearance
than you do,&rdquo; the man told her angrily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even
see him on the day of the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he came here. The wedding ring was found
near the pool. Surely you must have heard some sound
for I know you were in this part of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the man said sullenly. &ldquo;The only
persons I saw were a newspaper photographer and a
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take offense,&rdquo; Miss Kippenberg murmured,
getting up from the bench. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been terribly
upset these past few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked slowly to the edge of the pool. There
she stopped short, staring down at an object which
lay on the flagstones at her feet. It was the stick which
Penny had dropped only a moment before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; the gardener cried.</p>
<p>He went quickly to her side and took the damp
stick from her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been here prying around,&rdquo; he said
in a harsh voice. &ldquo;This was used to investigate the
water in the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whoever it was must be close by even now.
Otherwise the stick would have dried out in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go back to the house,&rdquo; the man commanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their hideout amid the bushes, Penny and Louise
gazed at each other with chagrin. No word was spoken
for even a whisper might have been heard. With a
common desire for escape, they glided with cat-like
tread toward the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">16</span>
<br /><i>GATHERING CLUES</i></h2>
<p>The girls could hear no movement behind them
as they darted down the path. They dared to hope that
they had eluded the old gardener.</p>
<p>Then as they came within sight of the river, Louise
stumbled over a vine. Although she stifled an outcry
the dull thud of her body against the ground seemed
actually to reverberate through the forest. A black
crow on the lower limb of an oak tree cawed in protest
before he flew away.</p>
<p>Penny pulled Louise to her feet and they went on
as fast as they could, but they knew the sound had
betrayed them. Now they could hear the man in pursuit,
his heavy shoes pounding on the hard, dry path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Penny commanded.</p>
<p>They reached the river bank and looked about for
the boat which would take them across. As they had
feared it was on the opposite shore.</p>
<p>Penny gestured frantically, but the boy did not
understand the need for haste. He picked up his oars
and rowed toward them at a very deliberate pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll never get here in time,&rdquo; Louise murmured
fearfully. &ldquo;Shall we hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They realized then that they had waited too long.
Before they could dodge into the deeper thicket the
gardener reached the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s you again!&rdquo; he cried wrathfully, glaring at
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, we didn&rsquo;t mean any harm. We can explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stick is explanation enough for me!&rdquo; the man
shouted, waving it above his head. &ldquo;You were trying
to find out about the lily pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were only trying to get a pin which I dropped
into the water,&rdquo; Louise said, backing a step away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo; the man snapped. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
fool me! I know why you came here, and you&rsquo;ll pay
for your folly! You&rsquo;ll never take the secret away
with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swift, animal-like spring which belied his
age, the gardener hurled himself toward the girls. He
seized Penny&rsquo;s arm giving it a cruel twist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming along with me,&rdquo; he announced
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Penny cried, trying to free herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going with me to the house. You&rsquo;ve been
altogether too prying. Now you&rsquo;ll take your punishment,
both of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The gardener might have managed Penny alone, but
he was no match for two athletic girls. As he tried
to seize Louise, Penny twisted free.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, she grasped the man&rsquo;s felt hat,
jamming it down on his head over his eyes. While he
was trying to pull it off, Louise also wriggled from
his grasp.</p>
<p>The two girls ran to the water&rsquo;s edge. Their boat
had drawn close to shore. Without waiting for it to
beach they waded out over their shoetops and climbed
aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t either of you ever come here again!&rdquo; the
gardener hurled after them. &ldquo;If you do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the threat was carried away by the
wind. However, Penny could not resist waving her
hand and calling back: &ldquo;Bye, bye, old timer! We&rsquo;ll
be seeing you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that man anyhow?&rdquo; asked
the boy who rowed the boat. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he want you
on the estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, he invited us to remain and we
declined,&rdquo; grinned Penny. &ldquo;Just temperament, that&rsquo;s
all. He can&rsquo;t make up his mind which way he would
like to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allowing the boy to puzzle over the remark, she
busied herself pouring water from her sodden shoes.
The visit to the estate had not turned out at all as
she had planned. She had failed to talk with Miss
Kippenberg, and it was almost certain that from now
on servants would keep a much closer watch for
intruders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>The only vital information she had gleaned resulted
from overhearing the conversation between Sylvia
Kippenberg and the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She talked with him as if they were well acquainted,&rdquo;
mused Penny. &ldquo;Miss Kippenberg must
have thought he knew more about Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s
disappearance than he would tell. And she seems to be
afraid the Law will ask too many questions. Otherwise,
she wouldn&rsquo;t have suggested getting rid of the
alligator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One additional observation Penny had made, but
she decided not to speak of it until she and Louise
were alone.</p>
<p>The boat reached shore and the two girls stepped
out on the muddy bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you need me again?&rdquo; inquired the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly
when. Where do you keep your boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the river just beyond that crooked maple tree.
I hide it in the bushes and I keep the oars inside a hollow
log close by. You won&rsquo;t have any trouble finding
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise said goodbye to the lad and
scrambled up the bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll not be going back to <i>that</i> place,&rdquo; the
latter declared emphatically. &ldquo;I just wonder what
would have happened if we hadn&rsquo;t broken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have been locked up in the stone
tower,&rdquo; Penny laughed. &ldquo;Then another one of my
theories would have proven itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your theories! You can&rsquo;t make me believe
that gardener didn&rsquo;t mean to harm us. He was a
very sinister character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sinister is a strong word, Lou. But I&rsquo;ll agree he&rsquo;s
not any ordinary gardener. Either he&rsquo;s been hired by
the Kippenberg family for a very special purpose or
else he&rsquo;s gained their confidence and means to bend
them to his own ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His own ends! Why, Penny, what do you mean?
Have you learned something you haven&rsquo;t told me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this. I&rsquo;m satisfied Old Peter is no gardener.
He&rsquo;s wearing a disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what won&rsquo;t you think of next! You&rsquo;ve been
reading too many detective stories, Penny Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I? Then there&rsquo;s no need to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; Louise cut in. &ldquo;Your ideas are
pretty imaginative, but I like to hear them anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considerate of you, old thing,&rdquo; Penny drawled in
her best imitation of an English accent. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
deserve to be told after that crack, but I&rsquo;ll do it anyhow.
When I pulled the gardener&rsquo;s hat down over his
eyes, I felt something slip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was his skin peeling off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wore a wig,&rdquo; Penny said soberly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
he looked so startled when I jerked the hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you actually see a wig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he must have had one on his head. I felt
it give, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past that fellow. But if
he isn&rsquo;t a gardener, then who or what is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I intend to do some intensive
investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed speculatively toward the drawbridge,
noting that the old watchman had been deserted by
the group of reporters. He sat alone, legs crossed, his
camp stool propped against the side of the gearhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk with him, Lou. He might be able to tell
us something about the different employees of the
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked over to where the old man sat, greeting
him with their most pleasant smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Penny.</p>
<p>The old man finished lighting his pipe before he
deigned to notice them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; repeated Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the watchman. He looked the two
girls over appraisingly and added: &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you children
a long ways off from your Ma&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>The remark both startled and offended Penny, but
instantly she divined that the old fellow&rsquo;s memory
was short and his eyesight poor. He had failed to
recognize her in everyday clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just out for a hike,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;You see, we get tired of all the ordinary places, so
we thought we would walk by here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested in your bridge,&rdquo; added Louise.
&ldquo;We just love bridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one ain&rsquo;t so good any more,&rdquo; the old man
said disparagingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it get lonely here?&rdquo; ventured Louise. &ldquo;Sitting
here all day long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did at first, Miss. But I got used to it. Anyway,
it beats leanin&rsquo; on a shovel for the gov&rsquo;ment. I got a
little garden over yonder a ways. You ought to see my
tomatoes. Them Ponderosas is as big as a plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever operate the bridge?&rdquo; Louise inquired,
for Penny had not told her that the structure was still
in use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure, Miss. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for. But it
ain&rsquo;t safe for nothin&rsquo; heavier than a passenger car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see the bridge lowered.&rdquo; Louise stared
curiously up at the tall cantilevers which pointed skyward.
&ldquo;When will you do it next time, Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davis, if you please, Miss. Thorny Davis they
calls me. My real name&rsquo;s Thorndyke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man pulled a large, silver watch from his
pocket and consulted it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In about ten minutes now, Mrs. Kippenberg will
be comin&rsquo; back from town. Then we&rsquo;ll make the old
hinge bend down agin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait,&rdquo; said Louise.</p>
<p>Penny nodded and then as Thorny did not seem to
object, she peeped into the gear house, the door of
which stood half open. A maze of machinery met her
eye&mdash;an electric motor and several long hand-levers.</p>
<p>Presently Thorny Davis listened intently. Penny
thought he looked like an old fox who had picked up
the distant baying of the pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>her</i> car a-comin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can tell
by the sound of the engine. Well, I reckon I might as
well let &rsquo;er down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorny arose and knocked the ashes from his corn-cob
pipe. He opened the door of the gear house and
stepped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see how you do it?&rdquo; asked Penny. &ldquo;I always
was interested in machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women will be runnin&rsquo; locomotives next,&rdquo;
Thorny complained whimsically. &ldquo;All right, come
on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old watchman pulled a lever on the starting
rheostat of the motor which responded with a sudden
jar and then a low purr. It increased its speed as he
pushed the lever all the way over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the power&rsquo;s on. The next thing is to drop &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thorny grasped one of the long hand-levers and
gently eased it forward. There was a grind of gears
engaging and the bridge slowly crept down out of
the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Penny did not miss a single move. She noted just
which levers the watchman pulled and in what order.
When the platform of the bridge was on an even keel
she saw him cut off the motor and throw all the gear
back into its original position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you could do &rsquo;er by yourself now?&rdquo; Thorny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe I could,&rdquo; Penny answered gravely.</p>
<p>The old watchman smiled as he stepped to the deck
of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so easy as it looks,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Well,
here comes the Missuz now and we&rsquo;re all ready for
her. Last time she came along I was weedin&rsquo; out my
corn patch and was she mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the black limousine rolled up to the drawbridge
Penny turned her face away so that Mrs. Kippenberg
would not recognize her. She need have had no uneasiness,
for the lady gazed neither to the right nor
the left. The car crept forward at a snail&rsquo;s pace causing
the steel structure to shiver and shake as if from
an attack of ague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I think this bridge is positively dangerous,&rdquo;
Louise declared. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to drive over
it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the old watchman again raised the cantilevers,
Penny studied his every move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a girl you&rsquo;re sure mighty interested in machinery,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I may grow up to be a bridgeman some day,&rdquo;
Penny said lightly. &ldquo;I notice you keep the gear house
locked part of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to do it or folks would tamper with the
machinery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man snapped a padlock on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to mosey down to my garden and
do a little hoein&rsquo;,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;You girls better
run along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, Louise started away, but Penny
made no move to leave. She intended to ask a few
questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorny, are you any relation to the Kippenberg&rsquo;s
head gardener?&rdquo; she inquired with startling abruptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I any relation to that old walrus?&rdquo; Thorny
fairly shouted. &ldquo;Am I any relation to <i>him</i>? Say, you
tryin&rsquo; to insult me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, but I saw the man this morning, and
I fancied I noticed a resemblance. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t
know the one I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know him all right.&rdquo; Thorny spat contemptuously.
&ldquo;New man. He acts as know-it-all and
bossy as if he owned the whole place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no one that has anything to do with
him. He&rsquo;s so good he can&rsquo;t live like the rest of the
servants. Where do you think I seen him the other
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was at the Colonial Hotel, eatin&rsquo; in the main
dining room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Colonial is quite an expensive hotel at Corbin,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best there is. They soak you two bucks just to
park your feet under one of their tables. Yep, if you
ask me, Mrs. Kippenberg better ask that gardener of
hers a few questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered himself of this tirade, Thorny
became calm again. He shifted his weight and said
pointedly: &ldquo;Well, I got to tend my garden. You girls
better run along. Mrs. Kippenberg don&rsquo;t want nobody
hangin&rsquo; around the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls obligingly took leave of him and walked
away. But when they were some distance away, Penny
glanced back over her shoulder. She saw Thorny down
on his hands and knees in front of the gear house. He
was slipping some object under the wide crack of the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to the padlock!&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;So that
was why he wanted us to leave first. We&rsquo;ll remember
the hiding place, Lou, just in case we ever decide to
use the drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>

<br /><i>A SEARCH FOR JERRY</i></h2>
<p>After leaving the Kippenberg estate, Penny
and Louise motored to Corbin. More from curiosity
than for any other reason they dined at the Colonial
Hotel, finding the establishment as luxurious as the
old watchman had intimated. A full hour and a half
was required to eat the fine dinner which was served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend, the gardener, does have excellent taste
in food,&rdquo; remarked Louise. &ldquo;What puzzles me is where
does he get the money to pay for all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The obvious answer is that he&rsquo;s not a gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has rooms here too, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering about it. I mean to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise glanced at her wristwatch. &ldquo;Do you think
we should take the time?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It will be late
afternoon now before we reach home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t take a minute to inquire at the desk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Leaving the dining room, the girls made their way
to the lobby. When the desk clerk had a free moment
Penny asked him if anyone by the name of Peter
Henderson had taken rooms at the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here by that name,&rdquo; the man told her.
&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll look to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He consulted a card filing system which served as a
register, and confirmed his first statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man I mean would be around sixty years of
age,&rdquo; explained Penny. &ldquo;He works as a gardener at
the Kippenberg estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have come to the wrong hotel,&rdquo; said
the clerk aloofly. &ldquo;We do not cater to gardeners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to people who employ gardeners, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our rates start at ten dollars a day,&rdquo; returned the
clerk coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does that include free linen and a bath?&rdquo;
Penny asked with pretended awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. All of our rooms have private baths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful,&rdquo; giggled Penny. &ldquo;We thought
this might be one of those places with a bath on every
floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly comprehending that he was being made
an object of sport, the clerk glared at the girls and
turned his back.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise went cheerfully to their car, very
much pleased with themselves for having deflated
such a conceited young man. They drove away, and
late afternoon brought them to Riverview, tired and
dusty from their long trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>After dropping her chum off at the Sidell home,
Penny rode directly to the newspaper office. Finding
no parking place available on the street, she ran her
car into the loading area at the rear of the building,
nosing into a narrow space which had just been vacated
by a paper-laden truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you lady,&rdquo; shouted an employee. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
park that scrap iron here. Another paper truck will
be along in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny switched off the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re new around here,&rdquo; she said, climbing
out. &ldquo;The next truck isn&rsquo;t due until five-twenty-three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who do you think you are, tellin&rsquo; me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The employee trailed off into silence as another
workman gave him a sharp nudge in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down,&rdquo; he was warned. &ldquo;If the boss&rsquo; daughter
wants to park her jitney in the paper chute it&rsquo;s okay,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I get it,&rdquo; the other mumbled.</p>
<p>Penny grinned broadly as she crossed the loading
area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this, you might mention my automobile in a
more respectful tone,&rdquo; she tossed over her shoulder.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not scrap iron or a jitney either!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Riding up the freight elevator, Penny passed a few
remarks with the smiling operator and stepped off
at the editorial floor. She noticed as she went through
the news room that Jerry Livingston&rsquo;s desk was vacant.
And because the waste basket was empty, the floor beside
it free from paper wads, she knew he had written
no story that day.</p>
<p>Penny tapped lightly on the closed door of her
father&rsquo;s private office and went in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, glancing up. &ldquo;Just get back from
Corbin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Louise and I had plenty of excitement, but
I didn&rsquo;t dig up any facts you&rsquo;ll dare print in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet Jerry anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young cub is taking a vacation at my expense,
running up a big motorboat bill! He should have been
back here three hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, be reasonable, Dad,&rdquo; said Penny teasingly.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect him to trace down those men just
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a wild chase anyway,&rdquo; the editor growled.
&ldquo;I let him do it more to please you than for any other
reason. But that&rsquo;s beside the point. He was told to be
back here by four o&rsquo;clock at the latest, even if he had
nothing to report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry is usually punctual, Dad. But I suppose being
on the river he couldn&rsquo;t get here just when he
expected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably gone fishing,&rdquo; Mr. Parker declared.</p>
<p>He slammed down the roll top on his desk and
picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ride home with me?&rdquo; Penny invited.
&ldquo;Leaping Lena would be highly honored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty sight more comfortable on the bus,&rdquo;
her father replied. &ldquo;But then, I can stand a jolting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went out through the main room he paused
to speak with DeWitt, leaving an order that he was to
be called at his home as soon as Jerry Livingston returned.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker raised his eyebrows as he saw where
Penny had left the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you that the trucks need this space
to load and unload?&rdquo; he asked patiently. &ldquo;There is a
ten cent parking lot across the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad, I haven&rsquo;t ten cents to spare. The truth is,
I spent almost every bit of my allowance today over
at Corbin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; said Mr. Parker firmly. &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a penny will you get ahead of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misjudge me, Dad. I had no intention of even
mentioning such a painful subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove in silence for a few blocks and then
Penny indicated the gasoline gauge on the dashboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nearly empty!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t have enough to reach home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, get some,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker automatically.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to stall on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flip of the steering wheel brought the car to a
standstill in front of a gasoline pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill it up,&rdquo; ordered Penny.</p>
<p>While Mr. Parker read his newspaper, the attendant
polished the windshield and checked the oil, finding it
low. At a nod from Penny he added two quarts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be exactly two fifty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny repeated the figure in a louder tone, giving
her father a nudge. &ldquo;Wake up, Dad. Two fifty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absently, Mr. Parker reached for his wallet. Not
until the attendant brought the change did it dawn
upon him that Penny had scored once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tricked again,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was your own suggestion that we stop
for gasoline,&rdquo; Penny reminded him. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
minded taking a chance myself. You see, the gauge is
usually at least a gallon off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I would rather pay for it than have you
siphon it out of my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the present,&rdquo; laughed Penny.</p>
<p>Dinner was waiting by the time they reached home.
Afterwards, Penny helped Mrs. Weems with the
dishes while her father mowed the lawn. Hearing the
telephone ring he came to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that a call for me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad, it was for Mrs. Weems.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange DeWitt doesn&rsquo;t call,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said. &ldquo;I
believe I&rsquo;ll telephone him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mrs. Weems had finished with the phone he
called the newspaper office only to be told that Jerry
Livingston had not put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he might have communicated with the
office,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said as he hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>He went back to lawn mowing but paused now
and then to stare moodily toward the Kobalt river
which wound through the valley far below the terrace.
Penny finished drying the dishes and went outside
to join him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried about Jerry, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But he should have been
back long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never would have stayed away without good
reason. We both know Jerry isn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s either run into a big story, or he&rsquo;s in
trouble. When I sent him away this morning, I didn&rsquo;t
look upon the assignment as a particularly dangerous
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet if he met those two seamen anything
could have happened. They were tough customers,
Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could notify the police if Jerry isn&rsquo;t back within
an hour or two,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said slowly. &ldquo;Still, I
hate to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Jerry rent his boat, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him to get one at Griffith&rsquo;s dock at twenty-third
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we go there?&rdquo; suggested Penny.
&ldquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t come in we might rent a boat of our own
and start a search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker debated and then nodded. &ldquo;Bring a
heavy coat,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It may be cold on the
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ran into the house after the garments and
also took a flashlight from her father&rsquo;s bureau drawer.
When she hurried outdoors again her father had
backed his own car from the garage and was waiting.</p>
<p>At the twenty-third street dock, Harry Griffith,
owner of the boat house, answered their questions
frankly. Yes, he told them, Jerry Livingston had
rented a motor boat early that morning but had not
returned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been worryin&rsquo; about that young feller,&rdquo; he admitted,
and then with a quick change of tone: &ldquo;Say,
you&rsquo;re not Mr. Parker, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I got a letter here for you. I reckon maybe
it explains what became of the young feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman took a greasy envelope from his trousers
pocket and gave it to the editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this, Mr. Griffith?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A boy in a rowboat brought it up the river about
two hours ago. He said the young feller gave him a
dollar to deliver it to a Mr. Parker. But the kid was
mixed up on the address, so I just held it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, it must be from Jerry,&rdquo; said Penny eagerly.</p>
<p>As her father opened the envelope, she held the
flashlight close. In an almost illegible scrawl Jerry
had written:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following up a hot tip. Think I&rsquo;ve struck trail of
key men. Taking off in boat. Expect to get back by
nightfall unless Old Man Trouble catches up with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker looked up from the message, his gaze
meeting the frightened eyes of his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad,&rdquo; she said in a tone barely above a whisper,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s long after dark now. What do you think
has become of Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>OVER THE DRAWBRIDGE</i></h2>
<p>Wasting no moments in useless conversation,
Mr. Parker rented a fast motor boat and prevailed
upon Harry Griffith to operate it for him. Guided by
the stars and a half moon which was slowly rising
over the treetops, the party swung down the river.</p>
<p>Riding with the current, they came before long to
the locality where Penny and Jerry had first sighted
the two seamen&rsquo;s cruiser. But now there was no sign
of a boat, either large or small.</p>
<p>At a speed which enabled the occupants to scrutinize
the shoreline, the searching craft swept on. The
river had never seemed more deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry might have stopped anywhere along here,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker observed. &ldquo;If he drew the boat into the
bushes we haven&rsquo;t a chance of finding him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on, coming presently to the Kippenberg
estate. As they passed beneath the open drawbridge
Penny noted how low it had been swung over
the water. A boat with a high cabin could not possibly
go through when the cantilevers were down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Gazing upward, she saw a swinging red light at the
entrance to the bridge. A lantern, no doubt, hung
there to give warning to any motorist who might venture
upon the private road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorny probably isn&rsquo;t on duty at this hour,&rdquo;
Penny reflected. &ldquo;But I should think an open drawbridge
might prove more dangerous at night than in
the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the bridge was lost to view beyond a bend in
the river, she gave all her attention to watching the
coves and inlets. Her father sat hunched over in the
seat beside her, slapping at mosquitoes. Now and then
he would switch on the flashlight to look at his watch.</p>
<p>Gradually the river had widened, so that it was
possible to cover only one shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll search the other side on our return trip,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker said. &ldquo;But it looks to me as if we&rsquo;re not
going to have any luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to add to the discouragement of the party,
dark clouds began to edge across the sky. One by
one the stars were inked out. Penny&rsquo;s light coat offered
scant protection from the cold wind.</p>
<p>And then, Harry Griffith throttled down the motor
and spun the wheel sharply to starboard. He leaned
forward, trying to pierce the black void ahead of the
boat&rsquo;s bright beam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like something over there,&rdquo; he said pointing.
&ldquo;Might be a log. No, it&rsquo;s a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anyone in it!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s drifting
with the current.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like one of my boats, sure as you&rsquo;re
born,&rdquo; Griffith declared, idling the engine. &ldquo;The same
I rented the young feller this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Jerry?&rdquo; cried Penny.</p>
<p>Griffith maneuvered his own boat close to the one
which drifted with the current. Mr. Parker was able
to reach out and grasp the long rope dangling in the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flashlight, Penny!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>She turned the beam on, and as it focused upon
the floor of the boat, drew in her breath sharply. On
the bottom, face downward, lay a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jerry!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;Oh, Dad, he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Steady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Griffith held the two boats together, he
stepped aboard the smaller one. He bent over the
crumpled figure, feeling Jerry&rsquo;s pulse, gently turning
him upon his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he alive, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His pulse is weak, but I can feel it. Yes, he&rsquo;s breathing!
Hold that light steady, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, there&rsquo;s blood on his head! I&mdash;I can see it
trickling down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been struck with a club or some blunt object,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker said grimly. &ldquo;He may have a fractured
skull.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a grip on yourself,&rdquo; her father ordered
sternly, &ldquo;It may not be as bad as I think, but we&rsquo;ll
have to rush him to the nearest doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was me, I wouldn&rsquo;t try to move him out of
there,&rdquo; advised Harry Griffith. &ldquo;Leave him where
he is. I&rsquo;ll get aboard and we&rsquo;ll take this boat in tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny helped the man make their craft fast to the
other boat, and then they both climbed aboard. Griffith
started the engine and turned around in the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll head for Covert,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the
closest place. There ought to be a good doctor in a
town that size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Griffith handled the boat, Penny and her
father did what they could to make Jerry comfortable.
They stripped off their coats, using one for a
pillow, and the other to cover his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two men he was sent to follow must be
responsible for this!&rdquo; Penny murmured. &ldquo;How could
they do such a brutal thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll notify the police as soon as we touch shore,&rdquo;
her father said grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll search every cove and
inlet until we find the ones responsible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke Mr. Parker bent lower to examine the
wound on Jerry&rsquo;s head. Blood had nearly stopped
flowing and he was hopeful that it came from a flesh
wound. He pressed a clean handkerchief against it
and the young man stirred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose he&rsquo;s been like this,
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell. An hour, maybe two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, as the boat made full speed up the river,
Jerry stirred once more. His lips moved but the words
were indistinguishable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far to Covert?&rdquo; Mr. Parker asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four miles from this point,&rdquo; Griffith flung
over his shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the next town above the Kippenberg
estate. I&rsquo;m making the best time I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry moved restlessly, his hands plucking at the
coat which covered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flaming eyes,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Looking at me&mdash;looking
at me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father gazed at each other in startled
dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s completely out of his head,&rdquo; whispered
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone back to that other accident which happened
last year,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The Vanishing
Houseboat affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s had more than his share of bad luck, Dad.
Twice now on this same river, he&rsquo;s met with disaster.
And this time he may not come through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will if his skull hasn&rsquo;t been fractured,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker told her encouragingly. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry&rsquo;s lips were moving again, and this time his
words were more rational.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get word to the Chief,&rdquo; they heard him
mutter. &ldquo;Got to get word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long while after that Jerry remained perfectly
quiet. Suddenly arousing, his eyes opened wide and
he struggled to sit up. Mr. Parker gently pressed him
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; Jerry muttered. &ldquo;Let me out of
here! Let me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Jerry,&rdquo; soothed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re with
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter&rsquo;s tense grip on the editor&rsquo;s hand relaxed.
&ldquo;That you, Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jerry. Just lie quiet. We&rsquo;ll have you to a
doctor in a few more minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor! I don&rsquo;t need any doctor,&rdquo; he protested,
trying once more to sit up. &ldquo;What happened anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you remember anything, Jerry?&rdquo; Penny
asked. &ldquo;You went out on the river to try to trace
those two men in the cruiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s coming back to me now. I ran into their
boat down by Cranberry Cove. They tied up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what happened?&rdquo; Penny demanded, as
Jerry paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw &rsquo;em walk ashore. Thought I would follow
so I tied up my boat, too. They started off through
the trees. Pretty soon they met a third man, a well
dressed fellow, educated too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any of their conversation?&rdquo; Mr.
Parker questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Kippenberg&rsquo;s name mentioned. That
caught my interest so I crept closer. Must have given
myself away because that&rsquo;s about the last I remember.
A ton of dynamite seemed to explode in my head.
And here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, you were struck from behind with
some heavy object,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said. &ldquo;They probably
dumped you back in your own boat and set it adrift.
You never saw your attacker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry rested for a moment, and then as it dawned
upon him that he was being speeded to a doctor, he
began to protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Chief, I&rsquo;ll be all right. I don&rsquo;t need any doc.
Head&rsquo;s clear as a bell now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, Jerry. But you&rsquo;ll see a doctor anyway
and have X-rays. We&rsquo;re taking no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at least let me go back to Riverview,&rdquo; Jerry
grumbled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in any hick town
hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel equal to the trip, I guess we can grant
you that much. You seem to be all right, but I want
to make sure. Can&rsquo;t take chances on the paper being
sued later on, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I get the idea,&rdquo; said Jerry with a grimace.
&ldquo;Thinking of the old cash register, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Penny drew a deep sigh of relief. If Jerry were
able to make jokes he couldn&rsquo;t be seriously injured.
She still felt weak from the fright she had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police will find those men who attacked you,&rdquo;
she told him. &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re put in prison for life,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police?&rdquo; Jerry repeated. He stared up into
Mr. Parker&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Say, Chief, you&rsquo;re not aiming to
spill the story, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, if you notify the police, we&rsquo;ll show
our hand to the rival paper. If we keep this dark we
could do our own investigating, and maybe land a big
scoop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice is more important than a scoop, Jerry,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Parker. &ldquo;If those men had anything to
do with Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance, and it looks as if
they did, then we are duty bound to hand our clues
over to the police. By trying to handle it alone, we
might let them escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess maybe you&rsquo;re right at that,&rdquo; Jerry acknowledged.</p>
<p>As she saw that the reporter was rapidly recovering
strength, Penny left him to the care of her father and
went forward to speak with Harry Griffith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just comin&rsquo; to the Kippenberg estate,&rdquo; he told
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that far? We don&rsquo;t seem to be making very
fast time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re buckin&rsquo; the current, Miss. And there&rsquo;s a
right stiff wind blowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not noticed the wind before or how overcast
the sky had become. One could not see many
yards in advance of the boat.</p>
<p>Ahead loomed the drawbridge in open position as
usual. But Penny could not see the red lantern which
she had noticed upon the trip down. Had the light
been blown out by the wind?</p>
<p>In any case, it would not greatly matter, she reflected.
Few cars traveled the private road. And any
person who came that way would likely know about
the bridge.</p>
<p>And then, above the steady hum of the motor boat
engine, Penny heard another roar which steadily increased
in intensity. A car was coming down the road
at great speed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lantern must be there,&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
probably hidden by a tree or the high bank. Of course
it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She listened with a growing tension. The car was
not slowing down. Even Harry Griffith turned his
head to gaze toward the entrance ramp of the drawbridge.</p>
<p>It was all over in an instant. A scream of brakes,
a loud splintering of the wooden barrier. <a href="#front">The speeding
automobile struck the side of the steel bridge,
spun sideways and careened down the bank to bury
itself in the water.</a></p>

<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>A DARING RESCUE</i></h2>
<p>Those in the motor boat who had witnessed the
disaster were too horrified to speak. They could see
the top of the car rising above the water into which
it had fallen, but there was no sign of the unfortunate
driver or other possible occupants.</p>
<p>Penny began to kick off her shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted her father, divining her purpose.
&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s too dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not heed for she knew that if the persons
in the car were to be saved it must be by her
efforts. Her father could not swim well and Harry
Griffith was needed at the wheel of the motor boat.</p>
<p>Scrambling to the gunwale, the girl dived into the
water. She could see nothing. Groping her way to
the overturned coupe, she grasped a door handle and
turned it. All her strength was required to pull the
door open. Her breath was growing short now. She
worked faster, with frantic haste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>A hand clutched her own. Before she could protect
herself she felt the man upon her, clawing, fighting,
trying to climb her shoulders, upward to the
blessed air.</p>
<p>His grasp was loose. Penny ducked out of it but
held fast to his hand. She braced her feet against the
body of the car and pushed. They both shot upward
to the surface.</p>
<p>Griffith and her father lifted the man out of the
water into the motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to go down again,&rdquo; Penny gasped. &ldquo;There
may be others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dived once more, doubling herself into a tight
ball, and giving a quick, upthrust of her feet which
sent her straight to the bottom. She swam into the
car and groped about on the seat and floor. Finding
no bodies, she quickly shot to the surface again. Her
father pulled her over the side, saying curtly: &ldquo;Good
work, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The victim she had saved seemed little the worse
for his ducking. With Griffith&rsquo;s help he had divested
himself of his heavy coat and was wringing it out.</p>
<p>Penny had obtained no clear view of the man, nor
did she ever, for just at that moment, Jerry raised
himself to a sitting position. He stared at the bedraggled
one and pointed an accusing finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow!&rdquo; he cried in an excited voice.
&ldquo;The one I was telling you about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The man took one look at Jerry and gazed quickly
about. By this time the motor boat had drifted close
to shore. Before anyone could make a move to stop
him, the man hurled himself overboard. He landed
on his feet in shallow water. Splashing through to the
shore, he scuttled up the steep bank and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get away!&rdquo; shouted Jerry. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the same fellow I saw in the woods!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain?&rdquo; asked Mr. Parker doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! If you think I&rsquo;m out of my head now,
you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s crazy! It&rsquo;s the same fellow! Oh,
if I could get out of this boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griffith brought the craft to shore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I
can overtake him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s probably deep
in the woods by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman was a heavy-set man, slow on his feet.
Penny and her father were not surprised when he
came back twenty minutes later to report he had been
unable to pick up the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The overturned car may offer a clue to his identity,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker said, as they started up the river
once more. &ldquo;The police will be able to check the
license plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the man was doing at the estate?&rdquo;
Penny mused.</p>
<p>She groped her way toward the cabin, thinking
that she would divest herself of some of her wet garments.
Suddenly she stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, that fellow took off his coat!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;He must have left it behind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s somewhere on the floor,&rdquo; Harry Griffith called
to her.</p>
<p>Penny found the sodden garment lying almost at
her feet. She straightened it out and searched the
pockets. Her father moved over to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any clues?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Penny took out a water-soaked handkerchief, a key
ring and a plain white envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be something!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Handle it carefully so it doesn&rsquo;t tear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried the articles into the cabin. Mr. Parker
turned on the light and took the envelope from his
daughter&rsquo;s hand. They were both elated to see that
another paper was contained inside.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker tore off the envelope and flattened the
letter on the table beneath the light. The ink had
blurred but nearly all of the words could still be made
out. There was no heading, merely the initials: &ldquo;J.
J. K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could that mean James Kippenberg?&rdquo; Penny
asked.</p>
<p>The message was brief. Mr. Parker read it aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come through or your fate will be the same
as Atherwald&rsquo;s. We give you twenty-four hours to
think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed. &ldquo;That man I
pulled out of the water couldn&rsquo;t have been James
Kippenberg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely, Penny. My guess would be that he
had been sent here to deliver this warning note. Being
unfamiliar with the road, and not knowing about the
dangerous drawbridge, he crashed through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But James Kippenberg isn&rsquo;t supposed to be at the
estate,&rdquo; Penny argued. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make sense at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This much is clear, Penny. Jerry saw the man
talking with the two seamen, and they all appear to
be mixed up in Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance.
We&rsquo;ll print what we&rsquo;ve learned, and let the police
figure out the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, this story is developing into something big,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded as he moved a swinging light bulb
slowly over the paper, hastening the drying process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the next issue of the <i>Star</i> is printed, every
paper in the state will send their men here. But we&rsquo;re
out ahead, and when the big break comes, we may get
that first, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, if only we can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count yourself out of the case from now on,
young lady,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;You scared the wits
out of me tonight, risking your life to save that no-good.
Now shed those wet clothes before you come
down with pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>He tossed her an overcoat, a sweater and a crumpled
pair of slacks which Griffith had found under
one of the boat seats. Leaving the cabin, he closed
the door behind him.</p>
<p>Penny did not change her clothes at once. Instead,
she sat down at the table, studying the warning message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Better come through,&rsquo;&rdquo; she read aloud. &ldquo;Does
that mean Kippenberg is supposed to pay money?
And what fate did Atherwald meet?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>AN IMPORTANT INTERVIEW</i></h2>
<p>Those same questions were pounding through
Penny&rsquo;s mind the next morning when she read the
first edition of her father&rsquo;s paper. Propped up in bed
with pillows, she perused the story as she nibbled at
the buttered muffins on her breakfast tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you would like?&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems inquired, hovering near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite all right,&rdquo; smiled Penny. &ldquo;Not even
a head cold after my ducking. Have you heard about
Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father said he was doing fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he leave any message for me before going to
the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he thought you should stay in bed all
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad would,&rdquo; Penny pouted. &ldquo;Well, I feel just fine.
I&rsquo;m getting up right away.&rdquo; She heaved aside the bed
clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Then, because she couldn&rsquo;t get the Kippenberg
case out of her head, she dressed quickly and went
downstairs. She was going out the front door when
Mrs. Weems stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where are you going, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s bright eyes twinkled and she flashed the
housekeeper an arch, provocative smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sure just where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; she replied, her
smooth forehead creasing with thought. &ldquo;But if Dad
should get curious, you can tell him he shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if he finds me visiting with the Kippenbergs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny! You&rsquo;re not going there again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I&rsquo;m after a story for the <i>Riverview Star</i>
and I mean to get it. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand Penny walked jauntily
off. A few moments later Mrs. Weems heard the clatter
of Penny&rsquo;s Leaping Lena careening down the street
in the direction of Corbin. First, however, she called
for her chum, Louise, who was eager to accompany
her on the long ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to stay long, Penny,&rdquo; said Louise.
&ldquo;Mother wants me to go shopping with her later this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; responded Penny as the old car
bolted along the road. &ldquo;If I get delayed, you can take
Leaping Lena back home, and I&rsquo;ll follow later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With both girls keeping up a steady run of conversation
they soon reached their destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Penny wondered if she would be able to enter the
Kippenberg estate without being challenged by the
bridgeman or a servant. Her anxiety increased upon
approaching the river, for she saw that a large group
of persons had gathered by the drawbridge.</p>
<p>No one paid the slightest attention to the two girls
as they abandoned the car and proceeded to the water&rsquo;s
edge. Penny was pleased to find the youthful
boatman at his usual haunt on the river. He rowed the
girls across to the estate, promising to await their return.</p>
<p>Penny escorted Louise through the trees to the
Kippenberg house. Boldly she rang the doorbell which
was answered by a butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to speak with Mrs. Kippenberg,&rdquo; she
requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam will see no one,&rdquo; began the man.</p>
<p>Footsteps sounded behind him in the hallway and
Mrs. Kippenberg stood in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is you?&rdquo; she asked in an icy voice. &ldquo;Julius, see
that this person is ejected from the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment please,&rdquo; interposed Penny. &ldquo;If I
leave now, I warn you that certain facts will be published
in the <i>Star</i>, facts which will add to your embarrassment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can print nothing which will humiliate us
further.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No? You might like to have me mention the alligator
in your lily pool. And the reason why you
and your daughter are so anxious to be rid of it before
the police ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kippenberg&rsquo;s plump face flushed a deep red.
But for once she managed to keep her temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish of me?&rdquo; she asked frigidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, tell me about that painting, &lsquo;The Drawbridge&rsquo;
which was presented to your daughter as a
wedding gift. Was it not given to her by your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not answer your question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you prefer that I print my own conclusions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an impudent, prying young woman!&rdquo;
Mrs. Kippenberg stormed. &ldquo;What if the picture was
given to Sylvia by her father! Is that any crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Penny soothingly. &ldquo;It merely
proves that you both know the whereabouts of Mr.
Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do. But I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing, absolutely
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few questions to ask about your new
gardener,&rdquo; Penny went on, unmoved. &ldquo;For instance,
why does he wear a wig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door slammed in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly was a very cold reception,&rdquo; remarked
Louise as the girls walked away, the sound
of the slamming door still ringing in their ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Penny shrugged her shoulders and smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
nothing. When you&rsquo;re a reporter you have to expect
those things.&rdquo; She looked about the deserted estate.
&ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll do some more sleuthing in the
vicinity of the pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise looked at her wristwatch. &ldquo;Goodness, it&rsquo;s
getting late,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to stay, Penny, but
I think I&rsquo;d better be getting home to meet Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;You take Leaping Lena.
The boy in the boat will row you across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will you get home, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ll find a way. You just
go on. I only hope the old bus holds up all the way
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise laughed and then the two girls walked to
the boat dock. In a few moments the boy in the rowboat
appeared and took Louise across. Afterward,
Penny turned back through the trees and went on to
the forbidden part of the estate.</p>
<p>She spent a long time about the pool, examining the
earth all about it, but she failed to learn anything
new. Finally, she retraced her steps to the river. She
expected to find the boy waiting for her, but he had
disappeared. She walked through the trees to the boat
dock and stood there until the old watchman on the
other side observed her predicament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>He obligingly lowered the drawbridge and she
crossed the river, pausing at the gear house to chat
with him.</p>
<p>Penny listened without comment to his story of
the automobile accident. Thorny had his own version
of how it had occurred and she did not correct any
of the details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a way to get into Corbin,&rdquo; she remarked
when he had finished his lengthy account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you walk down to the main road you kin catch
the county bus,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;It runs every hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long hike along a dusty highway, an equally
tedious wait at a crossroad, and finally Penny arrived
in Corbin. She went directly to the Colonial Hotel,
placing a telephone call to her father&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing in Corbin, Penny?&rdquo; her
father demanded as he recognized her voice.</p>
<p>Penny answered him eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made an important
discovery which may blow your case higher
than a kite. No, I can&rsquo;t tell you anything over the
telephone. The reason I am calling is that I may need
help. Is Jerry still in the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never was there,&rdquo; responded her father. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t make him go. He and Salt are out on the
river looking for the men who cracked him over the
head. I expect they&rsquo;ll call in any time now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you do get in touch with Jerry, ask him to
meet me at the Colonial Hotel,&rdquo; urged Penny. &ldquo;I have
a hunch the big story is about to break. In any event
I&rsquo;ll need a ride home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a great deal more to the conversation,
with Mr. Parker delivering a long lecture upon the
proper deportment for a daughter. Penny closed her
ears, murmuring at regular intervals, &ldquo;Yes, Dad,&rdquo; and
finally went back to her post in the lobby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>THE WHITE CRUISER</i></h2>
<p>For at least an hour she waited. She watched the
clock until the hands pointed to six o&rsquo;clock. Tantalizing
odors came to her from the dining room, but she
resolutely downed her hunger. She did not wish to
give up her vigil even for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Finally Penny&rsquo;s patience was rewarded. She saw a
man moving across the lobby toward the desk. He
wore well-cut tailored clothes and a low-brimmed
felt hat, yet the girl recognized him at a glance. He
was the Kippenberg gardener.</p>
<p>The man paused at the desk and asked for a key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Hammil,&rdquo; said the clerk, handing
it over.</p>
<p>Penny had noted that the key was taken from a
mailbox which bore the number, 381.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my friend, the gardener, has an alias,&rdquo; she
mused. &ldquo;Several of them, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Another half hour elapsed while the girl waited
patiently in her chair. Each time the elevator descended
she watched the people alight. At exactly six
forty-five Mr. Hammil stepped out of the lift, and
without glancing toward the girl, dropped his key
on the desk and went into the dining room.</p>
<p>The clerk, busy with several newcomers at the
hotel, did not notice. Thinking that she saw her
chance, Penny slipped from her chair, sidled toward
the desk and picked up the key. Her heart pounded
as she walked toward the elevator, but no one called
to her. Her action had passed unobserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third floor,&rdquo; said Penny, and the elevator shot
upward.</p>
<p>She located room 381 at the far end of the hall,
and with a quick glance in both directions, unlocked
the door and entered.</p>
<p>An open suitcase lay upon the luggage rack by the
dresser. In systematic fashion Penny went through it,
finding an assortment of interesting articles&mdash;a revolver,
and two wigs, one of gray hair, the other black.
There were no letters or papers, nothing to positively
identify the owner of the luggage. But in the very
bottom of the case Penny came upon a photograph.
It was a picture of Sylvia Kippenberg.</p>
<p>Penny slipped the picture into the front of her
dress, hastily replaced everything as she had found it,
relocked the door, and returned to the lobby. As she
went toward the desk intending to rid herself of the
key, she stopped short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Jerry Livingston stood there talking earnestly with
the clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was told to come here,&rdquo; she heard him protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a girl in the lobby a few minutes ago,&rdquo;
the clerk replied. &ldquo;She went off somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, here I am, Jerry!&rdquo; Penny cried.</p>
<p>The reporter turned around and his face lighted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come outside, Jerry,&rdquo; Penny said before he could
speak. &ldquo;I have a great deal to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have some news of my own,&rdquo; returned the
reporter.</p>
<p>They left the hotel together. Once beyond hearing,
Penny made a complete report of her afternoon
adventure, and showed Jerry the picture of Sylvia
Kippenberg which she had taken from room 381.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for my story,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve located a
place not far from here where those two seamen buy
supplies. The owner of the store told me they tie
their boat up there nearly every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Salt now, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s keeping watch at the place. I came into town
to telephone the <i>Star</i> office. Your father said I was
to stop here and take you in tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not starting back to Riverview?&rdquo; Penny
asked in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, Penny. I have a feeling our big
story is just about ready to break!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So have I, Jerry. Let&rsquo;s stay with it. I&rsquo;ll explain to
Dad when we get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s be on our way,&rdquo; the reporter said
crisply. &ldquo;No telling what has developed while I&rsquo;ve
been in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the press car, the couple took the river road
which led east from the Kippenberg estate. As they
bounced along, making all possible speed, Jerry told
Penny how he and Salt had traced the two seamen.
They had made inquiry all along the river, and quite
by chance had encountered a fisherman who had given
them a valuable tip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But so many rumors are false, Jerry,&rdquo; Penny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tip was straight. Salt and I found the white
cruiser tied up at the dock not far from this store I
was telling you about. We&rsquo;ve been watching it for
the past two hours, and Salt is still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have done any good. The men we&rsquo;re
after haven&rsquo;t been there all day. The only person on
board is a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you would say a young woman.
About twenty-two, I&rsquo;d guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, you must be watching the wrong boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry shook his head as he drove the car into the
bushes at the side of the road. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right one,
I&rsquo;m sure of it. Well, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Penny was hard pressed to keep up as the reporter
led her through the trees down to the winding Kobalt
river. They found Salt in his hiding place, behind a
large boulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything happen since I left?&rdquo; Jerry demanded.</p>
<p>Salt scarcely noticed Penny&rsquo;s presence save to give
her a quick nod of welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got back just in time,&rdquo; he replied to the question.
&ldquo;The girl went away a minute ago. Took a
basket and started for the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are we waiting?&rdquo; asked Jerry. &ldquo;Come
on, we&rsquo;ll take a look inside that boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone ought to stay here and keep watch,&rdquo;
Salt returned. &ldquo;She may come back any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re elected guard then. Penny and I will look
the boat over and see what we can find. If the girl
starts back, whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darting across the muddy shore, Penny and Jerry
reached the dilapidated boat which had been tied up
at the end of a sagging dock. They jumped aboard
and after a hasty glance over the deck, dived down
into the cabin.</p>
<p>The room was dirty and in great disorder. Boots
lay on the floor, discarded garments were scattered
about, and a musty odor prevailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; said Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look around carefully,&rdquo; insisted Penny. &ldquo;We
may find something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Crossing the cabin she opened a closet door. Save
for a pair of oilskins which hung from a nail, it was
quite empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Penny suddenly.</p>
<p>Jerry stood absolutely still, straining to hear. A
long, low whistle reached his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warning signal!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Come on,
Penny, we&rsquo;re getting out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>TRAPPED IN THE CABIN</i></h2>
<p>Penny opened the door of the cabin only to
close it quickly. She and Jerry both had heard men&rsquo;s
voices very close to the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Those men have
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re alone. But we&rsquo;re in a trap. What shall
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could make a dash for it. If we have to fight
our way out, Salt will be there to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stick and see what happens, Jerry. We&rsquo;re
after information. We must expect to take a chance
in order to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry had been thinking more of Penny&rsquo;s safety
than his own. But thus urged, he turned the key in
the lock, bolting the door from the inside.</p>
<p>A low rumble of voices reached the couple as they
stood with ears pressed against the panel. But they
were unable to distinguish words. Then presently, one
of the seamen moved close to the companionway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it, Jake,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s down in the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Penny kept quiet as the man turned the
door knob. He heaved angrily against the panel with
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Jake,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the idea of locking
the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lock it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Flora did.&rdquo; Muttering under his breath, the
seaman tramped back up on deck.</p>
<p>Perhaps ten minutes elapsed before Penny and Jerry
heard a feminine voice speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be Flora,&rdquo; whispered Penny. &ldquo;What
will happen when she tells them that she didn&rsquo;t lock
the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices above rose louder and louder until the
two prisoners were able to distinguish some of the
words. Jake berated the girl as stupid while his companion
showered abuse upon her until she broke
down and wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never had the key,&rdquo; they heard her wail. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what became of it. You always blame me for
everything that goes wrong, and I&rsquo;m good and sick of
it. If I don&rsquo;t get better treatment I may tell a few
things to the police. How would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Jerry and Penny did not hear the response, but
they recoiled as a loud crashing sound told them the
girl had been given a cruel push into a solid object.
Her cry of pain was drowned out by another noise,
the sudden clatter of the motor boat engine.</p>
<p>Penny and Jerry gazed at each other with startled
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Jerry started to fit the key into the door lock, only
to have Penny arrest his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay and see it through,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;This
is our chance to learn the hide-out and perhaps solve
the mystery of Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the reporter agreed. &ldquo;But I wish you
weren&rsquo;t in on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the tiny window of the cabin, he and Penny
observed various landmarks as the boat proceeded
downstream. Perhaps half an hour elapsed before the
cruiser came to the mouth of a narrow river which
emptied into the Kobalt. From that point on progress
became slow and often the boat was so close to shore
that Penny could have reached out and touched overhanging
bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this stream was deep enough for a
motor boat,&rdquo; Jerry whispered. &ldquo;We must be heading
for a hide-out deep in the swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Salt has sense enough to call Dad and the
police,&rdquo; Penny said with the first show of nervousness.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be a long way from help.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>The boat crept on for perhaps a mile. Then it
stopped, and Penny assumed they had reached their
destination. Gazing out of the window again, she saw
why they were halted. A great tree with finger-like
branches had fallen across the river, blocking the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Jerry,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not be able
to go any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess again,&rdquo; the reporter muttered.</p>
<p>Penny saw then that one of the men had left the
boat and was walking along shore. He seemed not in
the least disturbed by the great tree and for the first
time it dawned upon her that it served a definite purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift &rsquo;er up, Gus,&rdquo; called the man at the wheel of
the boat.</p>
<p>His companion disappeared into the bushes. Several
minutes elapsed and then Penny heard a creaking
sound as if ropes were moving on a pulley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tree!&rdquo; whispered Jerry, his eyes flashing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
lifting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very slowly, an inch at a time, the great tree raised
from the water, its huge roots serving as a hinge.
When it was high enough, the motor boat passed
beneath the dripping branches and waited on the
other side.</p>
<p>Slowly, the tree was lowered into place once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever, mighty clever,&rdquo; Jerry muttered. &ldquo;Anyone
searching for the hide-out would never think of looking
beyond this fallen tree. To all purposes nature put
it here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nature probably did,&rdquo; Penny added. &ldquo;But our dishonorable
friends adapted it to their own use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the window Penny saw the man called
Gus reboard the boat.</p>
<p>Once more the cruiser went on up the narrow
stream, making slow but steady progress. Long shadows
had settled over the water. Soon it became dark.</p>
<p>Then a short distance ahead, Jerry and Penny observed
a light. As the boat drifted up to a wharf, a
man could be seen standing there with a glowing
lantern. They were unable to see his face, and quickly
dodged back from the cabin window to avoid being
noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all right, Aaron?&rdquo; the man at the
wheel asked, jumping ashore. He looped a coil of rope
about one of the dock posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaron!&rdquo; whispered Penny, gripping Jerry&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Aaron Dietz, Kippenberg&rsquo;s former business
associate. So he&rsquo;s the ringleader in this business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened, trying to hear the man&rsquo;s reply to the
question which had been asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, everything&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he responded gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound any too cheerful about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald still won&rsquo;t talk. Keeps insisting he
doesn&rsquo;t know where the gold is hidden. What bothers
me, I am beginning to think we made a mistake. He
may be telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is a fine time to be finding it out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, keep your shirt on, Gus. You and Jake will
get your pay anyhow. And even if Atherwald doesn&rsquo;t
know the hiding place we&rsquo;ll make Kippenberg come
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to find him first,&rdquo; the other retorted.
&ldquo;If you ask my opinion, you&rsquo;ve made a mess of the
whole affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one asked your opinion! We&rsquo;ll make Atherwald
tell tonight or else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man with the lantern started away from the
dock but paused before he had taken many steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get those supplies up to the shack,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;Then I want to talk with you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but we have to get the
cabin door open first. Flora locked it and lost the
key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the girl protested shrilly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
try to blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry and Penny knew that their situation now was
a precarious one. If they were found in the cabin they
would be taken prisoners and the exclusive story which
they hoped to write never would be theirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve trapped ourselves in this cubby-hole,&rdquo; the
reporter muttered. &ldquo;All my doing, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can hide in the closet, Jerry. The men may
not think to search there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noiselessly, they opened the door and slipped into
the tiny room. The air was hot and stuffy, the space
too narrow for comfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Jerry and Penny did not have long to wait before
there came a loud crash against the cabin door. The
two seamen were trying to break through the flimsy
panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a light, Flora,&rdquo; called one of the men.</p>
<p>Penny and Jerry flattened themselves against the
closet wall, waiting.</p>
<p>A panel splintered on the outside cabin door, and
a heavy tramping of feet told them that the men had
entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one in here, Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as we thought. Flora locked the door and
lied out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Someone else
must have done it while I was at the store. The door
was unlocked when I went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought I heard voices while we were coming
down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just a low murmur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imagined it,&rdquo; the man told her. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll take
a look in the closet to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked across the cabin toward the hiding place.
Penny and Jerry braced themselves for the moment
when the door would be flung open. They had trapped
themselves and now faced almost certain capture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">23</span>
<br /><i>AT THE HIDE-OUT</i></h2>
<p>Before the man could pull open the closet door,
a booming voice called impatiently from shore:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you coming? We have plenty of work
ahead of us tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distracted from his purpose, the searcher turned
aside without glancing into the closet. With his companion
and the girl, he left the cabin.</p>
<p>Penny and Jerry waited at least five minutes. When
all was silent above, they stole from their hiding place.
From the window they assured themselves that the
wharf was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we do now, start after the police?&rdquo;
Penny questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make certain Atherwald is here first. We
can&rsquo;t afford to be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A path led through the timber. As they followed
it, Jerry and Penny saw a moving lantern some distance
ahead. They kept it in sight until the three men
and Flora disappeared into a cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Stealing on through the darkness, Penny and Jerry
crept to the screen door. Peering in, they saw a barren
room containing a table, a cook stove and double-deck
bunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get supper on, Flora,&rdquo; one of the men ordered
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to cook anything for the prisoner?&rdquo; she
asked in a whining voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless he decides to talk. I&rsquo;ll find out if he&rsquo;s
changed his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who had been called Aaron crossed the
cabin to an adjoining room. He unlocked the door
which had been fastened with a padlock, and went
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atherwald must be in there,&rdquo; whispered Penny.</p>
<p>With one accord, she and Jerry tiptoed across the
sagging porch and posted themselves under a high
window. Glancing up they saw it contained no glass,
but had narrow iron bars in keeping with a prison
chamber.</p>
<p>Jerry lifted Penny up so that she could peep into
the room. By the light of the oil lantern she saw a
haggard young man sitting on the bed. Despite a
stubble of beard and unkempt hair, she instantly recognized
him as the missing bridegroom. She made another
observation, one which shocked her. The man&rsquo;s
wrists were handcuffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Grant Atherwald,&rdquo; she told Jerry as he lowered
her to the ground. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve treated him shamefully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Jerry held up his hand as a signal for silence.
In the room above the men were speaking and he
wished to hear every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Atherwald, have you changed your mind?
How about a little supper tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell you something I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; the
bridegroom retorted wearily. &ldquo;Kippenberg never confided
any of his secrets to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where his gold is hidden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever had any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he did. When the government passed a
law that it was illegal to keep gold, Kippenberg decided
to defy it. He had over half his fortune converted
into gold which he expected to re-convert into
currency at a great profit to himself. His plans went
amiss when government men listed him for investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know all about his private affairs,&rdquo;
Grant Atherwald said sarcastically. &ldquo;Strange that you
haven&rsquo;t learned the hiding place of the gold&mdash;if there
ever was any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do you no good to pretend, Atherwald!
Either you tell the hiding place, or we&rsquo;ll bring your
bride here to keep you company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare touch her, you fiend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, unless you decide to talk, she&rsquo;ll share
your fate, and I promise you it won&rsquo;t be a pretty one.
Now I&rsquo;ll leave you to think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>The door closed with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get the police here right away,&rdquo;
Jerry advised Penny in a whisper. &ldquo;No telling what
those scoundrels may try to do to Atherwald. We
haven&rsquo;t a moment to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take us hours to bring help here,&rdquo;
reasoned Penny. &ldquo;And if we try to use the motorboat
the gang will be warned and flee while we&rsquo;re
on our way down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, but we have to do something. Any
ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have one,&rdquo; Penny answered soberly. &ldquo;It
may sound pretty crazy. Still, I really believe it would
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly, she outlined what she had in mind. Jerry
listened incredulously, but as the girl explained and
elaborated certain details of her plan, his doubts began
to clear away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;And if your hunch
about the pool is wrong, we will be in a fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but we&rsquo;ll have to take a chance in order
to save Atherwald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everything went exactly according to plan it
might work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it, Jerry. Lift me up so I can attract
Atherwald&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter did as she requested. Penny tapped
lightly on the iron bars with her signet ring. She saw
Grant Atherwald start and turn his head. Penny repeated
the signal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>The man arose from the bed and stumbled toward
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get me out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try. You are handcuffed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my captor keeps the key in his pocket.
The room outside is always guarded. Did you bring
an implement to saw through the bars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we have another scheme in mind. But you
must do exactly as we tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; the bridegroom whispered eagerly, his
pale cheeks flooding with color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen closely,&rdquo; Penny instructed. &ldquo;When your
captor comes back tell him you have decided to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about the cache of gold,&rdquo; the man
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your captor that the hiding place is on the
Kippenberg estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would only involve Sylvia and Mrs. Kippenberg.
I&rsquo;ll do nothing to get them into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to obey instructions or no one can
help you,&rdquo; Penny said severely. &ldquo;Would you prefer
that those cruel men carry out their threat? They&rsquo;ll
spirit Sylvia away and try to force the truth from
her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell your captor that the gold is hidden in a
specially constructed vault lying beneath the lily
pool.&rdquo; Penny had resolved to act upon her hunch that
there was a trapdoor on the bottom of the pool. Now
as she issued instructions she wished that she might
have found some way of examining the pool to see if
she were right. However, she had to take a chance on
there being a vault beneath the pool.</p>
<p>Atherwald protested mildly. &ldquo;He would never believe
such a fantastic story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not as fantastic as it sounds,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;You must convince him that it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the men understand that to get the gold
they must drain the pool and raise a trapdoor in the
cement bottom. Ask to be taken with the men when
they go there tonight and demand that you be given
your freedom as soon as the gold is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never let me go alive. An identification
from me would send them all to prison for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ringleader is Aaron Dietz. At one time he
was employed by Mr. Kippenberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other two call themselves Gus and Jake. I
don&rsquo;t know their last names. Then there is a girl who
seems to be a sister to Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the day of the wedding I was handed a note
just as I reached the estate. It requested me to come at
once to the garden. While I waited there, two ruffians
sprang upon me from behind. Before I could cry out
they dragged me to their boat at the river&rsquo;s edge. I
was handcuffed, blindfolded and brought to this
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slamming of an outside door warned Penny
that she was wasting precious time in talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand your instructions?&rdquo; she whispered
hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then goodbye. With luck we&rsquo;ll have you free in
a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With luck is right,&rdquo; Jerry muttered as Penny slid
to the ground.</p>
<p>Aaron Dietz stood on the front porch staring out
into the night. Seeing him there, Penny and Jerry
circled widely before attempting to return to the
river. Satisfied that they had not been observed, they
boarded the boat and descended to the cabin.</p>
<p>For possibly an hour they sat in the dark, waiting
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if my little plan didn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Penny
remarked. &ldquo;I might have known it would be too
simple.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Jerry had risen to his feet. He went to the window
and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear anything?&rdquo; Penny whispered hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like someone coming down the path. We
ought to get into our cubby-hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They tiptoed to the closet and closed the door.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes they heard a confusion of
voices and the shuffle of feet as men boarded the
cruiser. Penny wondered if the group included Grant
Atherwald and was greatly relieved when she heard
him speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you think I would double-cross
you,&rdquo; he said distinctly. &ldquo;I am considering my own
welfare. You promised that if the gold is found you&rsquo;ll
give me my freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, you&rsquo;ll get it. But if you&rsquo;re lying about the
hiding place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were drowned out by the roar of the
motor boat engine. Penny and Jerry felt the floor beneath
them quiver and then gently roll. The cruiser
was under way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading for the Kippenberg estate!&rdquo; Penny
whispered. &ldquo;Oh, everything is starting out beautifully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope it ends the same way,&rdquo; said Jerry
morosely. &ldquo;I only hope it does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>SECRET OF THE LILY POOL</i></h2>
<p>The moon rode high in the heavens as the cabin
cruiser let go its anchor in a cove off the Kippenberg
estate. Penny who had been dozing for the past hour
in her self-imposed prison started up in alarm as Jerry
nudged her in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the deck above their heads they could hear the
men talking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come along with us, Atherwald,&rdquo; Aaron
Dietz said. &ldquo;Flora, you stay here and guard the boat.
If you see anyone watching or acting suspiciously,
blow the whistle two short blasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stay here alone,&rdquo; the girl whimpered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do as I say,&rdquo; the man ordered harshly.
&ldquo;Get started, Gus. It&rsquo;s two o&rsquo;clock now. We won&rsquo;t
have many hours before daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>In making her plans Penny had not once considered
that the men might leave a guard on the
cruiser. With the girl posted as a lookout they were
still prisoners in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get out of here now or never,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;What shall we do about Flora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rush her and take a chance on the whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slipped out of their hiding place and crawled
noiselessly up the steep stairway. Pausing there, they
watched the shadowy figure of the girl in the bow
of the boat. She was quite alone, for her companions
had disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; commanded Jerry in a whisper.</p>
<p>With a quick rush he and Penny were across the
deck. They approached Flora from behind and were
upon her before she could turn her head. Jerry grasped
her arms while Penny clapped a hand over her mouth
to prevent a scream. Although the girl fought fiercely,
she was no match for two persons.</p>
<p>Stripping off her sash, Penny gave it to Jerry to use
as a gag. They bound the girl&rsquo;s wrists and ankles, then
carried her down into the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to leave her like that,&rdquo; said Penny as they
went back on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your sympathy,&rdquo; replied Jerry. &ldquo;She
doesn&rsquo;t deserve it. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll soon set her free.
We must bring the police now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest house with a telephone is about a half
mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us long to cover the distance,&rdquo; Jerry
said, helping her down from the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go alone,&rdquo; urged Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here and
keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; Penny gave him a little push. &ldquo;And
hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jerry had reluctantly left, she plunged into
the trees, carefully picking her way along the path
which led to the lily pool. A short distance brought
her to the clearing. Halting, she saw the three men
and Grant Atherwald silhouetted in the bright moonlight.
The latter was still handcuffed, guarded by
Aaron Dietz who allowed his companions to do the
hard labor.</p>
<p>Gus and Jake had broken open the door of the stone
tower. The soft purr of a motor told Penny that they
had started draining the pool. She wondered what
the men would do when they discovered that the tank
contained a very live alligator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to put a crimp in their work,&rdquo; she
chuckled. &ldquo;Mr. Kippenberg couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a
more effective guard for his gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But gradually as the pool drained lower and lower,
it struck Penny as odd that the men did not notice
the alligator. Belatedly, it occurred to her that the
Kippenberg gardener had probably succeeded in getting
rid of the monster since her visit to the garden
earlier in the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that <i>would</i> happen,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Oh, well, even so Jerry ought to get here with the
police in ample time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the waning of the moon gave indication of
how swiftly the night was passing. Penny became
alarmed as she observed how fast the pool emptied.
Jerry would not have as long as she had anticipated.
But surely, he would bring help before it was too late.</p>
<p>Presently, one of the men shut off the motor in the
stone tower, saying with quiet jubilance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, she&rsquo;s empty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped down into the tank, and almost at once
uttered a cry of discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, just as he said! The ring to the trap!
Give us some help, Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Aaron Dietz and the bewildered bridegroom
watching from above, the two men raised the heavy
block of cement. Penny drew closer for she did not
wish to miss anything. She stood in the shadow of a
tree scarcely fifteen yards from where the men
worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stairway leads down into an underground
vault!&rdquo; Jake cried exultantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the hiding
place of the gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toss me your flashlight, Aaron,&rdquo; called Gus.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon have all of the treasure out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next ten minutes brought a confused whirl of
impressions. Penny&rsquo;s thoughts were in turmoil. Why
didn&rsquo;t Jerry come with the police? As soon as the
men carried the burden of gold to the boat they
would discover Flora, bound and gagged. Then they
would suspect that a trap had been laid. Oh, why
didn&rsquo;t Jerry hurry?</p>
<p>Gus and Jake had descended into the underground
vault. As the light reappeared, Penny was dumbfounded
to see that the men were empty handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing down there,&rdquo; Gus reported in disgust.
&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve been tricked!&rdquo; Aaron Dietz turned
furiously upon his prisoner. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the gold was here,&rdquo; answered Grant
Atherwald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock him up in the vault and start the water running,&rdquo;
advised Jake harshly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good way to be
rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion appealed to Aaron Dietz. At a
nod from him, Atherwald was seized and dragged
down into the pool. He was shoved into the vault,
but before the two men could lower the heavy
cement block into place, a signal from Dietz arrested
their action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>In her anxiety over Grant Atherwald, Penny had
moved closer to the pool. Without realizing that she
was exposing herself, she stood so that her shadow
fell clearly across the open space. Before she comprehended
her danger, Dietz hurled himself upon her,
seizing her roughly by the arms.</p>
<p>Penny struggled to free herself but could not. The
man&rsquo;s grip was like steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were spying!&rdquo; he exclaimed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was just watching,&rdquo; Penny stammered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you remember me? I am the girl who pulled you out
of the river when your car went over the drawbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked closely at her, and for an instant
she dared hope that he would recall her with gratitude.
But his face hardened again and he said unfeelingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know entirely too much, my little girl. This
is one story you will never write for your father&rsquo;s
paper. Your curiosity has proven your undoing. You
share the fate of your very good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sinking heart Penny realized by the man&rsquo;s
words that he knew her to be the daughter of a newspaper
publisher, and that he had guessed her part in
the trick played upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down you go!&rdquo; Dietz said harshly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>As he dragged her toward the pool, Penny screamed
at the top of her lungs. A hand was clapped over her
mouth. She bit it savagely, but her efforts to free herself
were of no avail.</p>
<p>The men shoved her headlong down the stone stairway
into the pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now scream as much as you like,&rdquo; Aaron Dietz
hurled after her. &ldquo;No one will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heavy stone slab dropped into place.</p>
<p>Penny picked herself up from the steps. Terror
gripped her, and with a sob she called frantically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Atherwald! Mr. Atherwald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here at the bottom of the steps,&rdquo; he answered with
a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only bruised. But my hands are still in cuffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny limped down the stairway and helped the
man to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one will ever
look for us down in this vault. And our cries will
never be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; Penny murmured encouragingly.
&ldquo;We may be able to lift the stone. Come let&rsquo;s try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mounting the stairs, they applied their shoulders
to the massive door, but their best efforts did not
raise it an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Atherwald suddenly.</p>
<p>They both could hear the sound of water running
into the empty pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour&rsquo;s time no one will ever guess that a
hidden vault lies beneath the tank!&rdquo; Atherwald
groaned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doomed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can hear the water splashing above us, our
voices might carry!&rdquo; Penny reasoned. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cry out
for help. Now, together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shouted over and over until their voices failed
them. Then, completely discouraged, they sagged
down on the stairway to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing went as I planned,&rdquo; Penny said dismally.
&ldquo;I really thought the gold was hidden in this vault.
If the men had found it, they would have spent hours
removing the loot to their boat. Jerry would have
come with the police and everything would have
been all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grant Atherwald was not listening to the girl&rsquo;s
words. He struggled to his feet, pressing his ear against
the trapdoor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water has stopped running!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Penny sprang up and stood beside
him, listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I hear voices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one accord, they shouted for help. Could it
be imagination or did they hear an answering cry?
As they repeated their frantic call, there was a scraping
on the stone above their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand away,&rdquo; ordered a muffled voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Before Penny and the bridegroom could obey, the
great door lifted. A deluge of water poured in, its
force nearly washing them from the steps. But in another
moment the passage was clear and they stumbled
up through the rectangular opening.</p>
<p>Jerry grasped Penny&rsquo;s hand, helping her out of the
vault. One of the blue-coated policemen aided Atherwald,
unfastening the handcuffs which held him a
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Penny?&rdquo; the reporter asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I feel like a drowned rat,&rdquo; she laughed, shaking
water out of her hair. Then, with a quick change of
mood she asked: &ldquo;Did you get Aaron Dietz and his
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jerry answered in disgust. &ldquo;When we crossed
the river five minutes ago, the cruiser was still there.
No sign of anyone around. I brought the police here,
and now I suppose they&rsquo;ve made their get-away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jerry, we can&rsquo;t let them escape! Send the
police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get worked up,&rdquo; the reporter soothed.
&ldquo;A squad started back just as soon as we found out
what had happened here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietz and his men must have seen the police crossing
the river,&rdquo; speculated Penny. &ldquo;They may have
hidden in the bushes, biding their time. By now
they&rsquo;ve slipped away in their boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it,&rdquo; Jerry admitted. &ldquo;I traveled as
fast as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>As one of the policemen lifted Penny out of the
pool, a noise which sounded like the back-firing of
an automobile, broke the stillness of the night. It was
followed by a volley of similar sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunfire!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny.</p>
<p>The policemen started at a run through the woods
toward the place where the white cruiser had last
been seen. Penny hesitated, and then took the opposite
direction, coming out of the woods at a point
directly opposite the drawbridge.</p>
<p>Gazing far up the river she could see the white
cruiser, flashes of fire coming from the cabin window
as the desperadoes exchanged shots with the police,
who were concealed in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boat will try to run for it in another minute,&rdquo;
Penny thought. &ldquo;If only the drawbridge were down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kicking off her shoes, she dived into the water,
swimming diagonally across the river to take advantage
of the swift current. Her powerful strokes
brought her to shallow water and she waded ashore
through ankle-deep mud. As she scrambled up the
slippery bank, her wet clothing plastered to her body,
she heard the roar of the cruiser&rsquo;s motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve started the engine!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;In another
minute the boat will be at the bridge. Hurry!
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Penny could force herself to no greater effort.
Breathless, she reached the gearhouse and groped
frantically under the door. Had Thorny failed to
hide the key there? No, her fingers seized upon it.</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement, she turned it in the
lock. The door of the gearhouse swung open. Now
could she remember how to lower the bridge? Any
mistake would be costly, for by this time she could
hear the cruiser racing down the river at full speed.
If only it were light enough so that she could see the
gears!</p>
<p>She pulled a lever and her heart leaped as the motor
responded with a pleasant purr. The power was on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to lower the bridge!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;But
which lever is the right one? I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a prayer in her heart she grasped the one
closest at hand and eased it forward. There was a
grinding of gears as the tall cantilevers began to move.
They were coming down, but oh, so slowly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!&rdquo; Penny whispered, as if
her words could speed the bridge on its journey.</p>
<p>The white cruiser drove onward at full speed.
Lower came the bridge. Penny held her breath, knowing
it would be a matter of inches whether or not the
boat would clear. The man at the wheel, aware of the
danger, did not swerve from his course.</p>
<p>The bridge settled into place. As the crash came,
Penny closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I did it! I&rsquo;ve stopped them!</i>&rdquo; she thought, and
sagged weakly against the gear house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>VICTORY FOR PENNY</i></h2>
<p>Minutes later Penny was still leaning limply
against the building when a car drove up to the bridge.
Her father, Salt, and a bevy of policemen and government
representatives sprang out and ran to her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, what happened?&rdquo; Mr. Parker clasped his
daughter in his arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re soaking wet! Didn&rsquo;t we
hear gunfire as we turned in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny waved her hand weakly toward the river
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your story, Dad. Pictures galore. Boat
smashes into dangerous drawbridge. Police pursue and
shoot it out with desperadoes, taking what&rsquo;s left of
&rsquo;em into custody. I&rsquo;m afraid to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were you doing while all this was going
on?&rdquo; demanded her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I was just waiting for the drawbridge to go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Mr. Parker, Salt, and the policemen he had brought
to the scene, rushed to the edge of the bridge. A
police boat had drawn up beside the badly listing
cruiser, and three men prisoners and a girl were being
taken off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad is it?&rdquo; Penny called anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All captured alive,&rdquo; answered her father. &ldquo;Salt, get
that camera of yours into action! Where&rsquo;s Jerry? He
would be missing at a time like this! What happened
anyhow? Can&rsquo;t someone tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had fully recovered the power of speech,
and with a most flattering audience, she recounted her
adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me just a minute,&rdquo; she interrupted herself.</p>
<p>Turning her back, she pulled a sodden photograph
from the front of her dress and handed it to her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This picture is in pretty bad shape,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s clue number one. You see, it&rsquo;s a photograph of
Miss Kippenberg, and on the back is written, &lsquo;To
Father, with all my love.&rsquo; I found the picture this
afternoon in Room 381 at the Colonial Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve located Kippenberg?&rdquo; one of the G
men demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. He&rsquo;s been masquerading as the Kippenberg
gardener, coming back here no doubt to witness the
marriage of his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrest him right away,&rdquo; said the government
man, turning to leave. &ldquo;Thanks for the tip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident Miss Kippenberg and her mother
had nothing to do with Grant Atherwald&rsquo;s disappearance,&rdquo;
Penny went on. &ldquo;Aaron Dietz plotted the
whole affair himself. I guess he must have learned
about Kippenberg&rsquo;s cache of gold while he worked
for the man. He believed that Grant Atherwald shared
the secret and could tell where the money was hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve located the gold, too, I suppose,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker remarked whimsically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dad, I slipped up there. I thought the gold
was in a secret vault under the alligator pool, but I
was wrong. I don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let the G men solve that mystery when they
take Kippenberg into custody,&rdquo; replied her father.
&ldquo;Our work is cut out for us now. We&rsquo;ll find Jerry,
talk with young Atherwald, and rout Miss Kippenberg
and her mother out of bed for an exclusive interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this time I am sure they&rsquo;ll answer questions,&rdquo;
declared Penny.</p>
<p>During the next hour the &ldquo;story&rdquo; was taken entirely
from her hands. Jerry, her father and Salt, knew
exactly how to gather every fact of interest to the
readers of the <i>Star</i>. Sylvia Kippenberg, overjoyed to
find her fianc&eacute; alive, posed for pictures with him,
and answered all questions save those which concerned
her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Not until a telephone call came from the Colonial
Hotel, saying that Mr. Kippenberg had been taken
into custody, would either Sylvia or her mother admit
that the man had posed as the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, it is true,&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg acknowledged
at last. &ldquo;James has been trying to avoid government
men for over a year. Wishing to return for
Sylvia&rsquo;s wedding, he disguised himself as a gardener.
Then after Grant&rsquo;s disappearance, he remained here
trying to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was your husband who managed to get rid
of the alligator?&rdquo; Penny interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were afraid police might ask embarrassing
questions. James disposed of it to a zoo late yesterday
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the cache of gold under the lily pool,&rdquo; said
Mr. Parker. &ldquo;What became of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there never was any?&rdquo; questioned Penny incredulously.
&ldquo;Then why was the vault ever built?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her the truth, Mother,&rdquo; Sylvia urged. &ldquo;She
deserves to know. Anyway, it can do Father no harm
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time my husband did have a considerable
supply of gold,&rdquo; Mrs. Kippenberg admitted. &ldquo;Since
he could not trust a bank he constructed his own
vault under the pool and placed the alligator there
as a precaution against prying persons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father really did nothing so very wrong,&rdquo;
Sylvia broke in. &ldquo;The gold was bought with his own
money. If he chose to sell it later at a profit it was
his own affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the opinion of the government,&rdquo; Mr.
Parker said with a smile. &ldquo;He held the gold illegally.
So your father disposed of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he shipped it out of the country months ago.
And no one will ever be able to prove anything
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband is a very clever man,&rdquo; added Mrs.
Kippenberg proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I
know a number of very clever government men, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, in dry clothing loaned to her by Miss Kippenberg,
Penny motored back to Corbin with her
father, Jerry, and Salt. There they learned that the
three prisoners had been locked up in jail, while
James Kippenberg was being questioned by government
operatives. He readily admitted that he had
disguised himself as the gardener but defied anyone
to prove he ever had disposed of illegal gold.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker did not wait to learn the outcome of the
interview. Instead he telephoned the big story to
DeWitt and arranged for complete coverage on every
new angle of the case. Satisfied that no more could be
learned that night, the party sped back toward Riverview.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aaron Dietz and his confederates ought to get
long prison sentences,&rdquo; Penny remarked as they drove
through the night. &ldquo;But what will happen to Mr.
Kippenberg, Dad? Do you think he will escape punishment
as his wife believes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get what is coming to him,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Parker. &ldquo;A government man told me tonight that
Kippenberg&rsquo;s income tax reports have been falsified.
And Kippenberg knew they had evidence against
him or he never would have gone into hiding. No,
even if it can&rsquo;t be proven that he held gold illegally,
he&rsquo;ll certainly be fined and given a year or so in
prison for tax evasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he receives a light sentence for Sylvia&rsquo;s
sake,&rdquo; said Penny. After a moment she added: &ldquo;Sylvia
and Grant Atherwald are going to be married tomorrow.
They told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fact we missed,&rdquo; declared Jerry. &ldquo;Penny
always is showing us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t prove myself so brilliant tonight,&rdquo;
responded Penny. &ldquo;When I was down in that vault I
decided I was just plain dumb. If you hadn&rsquo;t had sense
enough to guess where Grant Atherwald and I were
being held&mdash;well, Dad would have had to adopt a new
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was easy enough to tell what had happened,&rdquo;
said Jerry. &ldquo;You had told me you thought there was a
secret vault beneath the pool. Then, too, I found
your handkerchief floating in the bottom. The water
had only been running in a few minutes.&rdquo; He fished
in his pocket and brought out a pin which he handed
to Penny. &ldquo;I also found this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jerry,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Louise&rsquo;s
cameo pin. She dropped it the day we were on the
Kippenberg estate together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police gave you full credit for the capture of
those men, Penny,&rdquo; said her father with pride. &ldquo;You
yanked the drawbridge just in time to trap them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt did his share, too,&rdquo; mentioned Penny generously.
&ldquo;He went for the police just as soon as he
realized Jerry and I had been carried away on the
cruiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only trouble was that the cops wasted too
much time searching for you down river,&rdquo; the photographer
drawled. &ldquo;We finally went back to Corbin
and ran into Mr. Parker who suggested we come to
the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to be in Corbin, Dad?&rdquo;
asked Penny curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might know&mdash;I was looking for you. Isn&rsquo;t
that my usual occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not provoked at me, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; the publisher answered
warmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all done fine work tonight. This is
the biggest story we&rsquo;ve run into in over a year! We&rsquo;ll
score a beat on the rival papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you think Jerry and Salt have earned
a raise?&rdquo; suggested Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed her father absently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of
it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you might tack on another dollar to my allowance,
Dad. I&rsquo;ll also have a small bill to present.
There will be several dollars for gasoline, lunches going
and coming from Corbin, two ruined dresses, a
pair of torn silk stockings, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Parker with a laugh.
&ldquo;If you keep on listing your expenses, I&rsquo;ll be broke.
You turned out to be an expensive reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was worth it, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Penny demanded,
placing her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>Her father agreed heartily. &ldquo;It certainly was,
Penny. The <i>Riverview Star</i> obtained a smashing story
to scoop all the other newspapers, and I&rsquo;ve got my
elusive daughter back again safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny moved closer to her father. She grasped the
lapels of his coat in her slender fingers and tipped her
weary but still lovely face toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, will you promise me one thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what you are after,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
told her gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever the <i>Riverview Star</i> has a baffling
mystery to be run down to earth, will you promise to
call in your ace sleuth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who would that be?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Parker
with a puzzled frown. Then as Penny laughed gaily,
he also started to grin. &ldquo;So you are the ace sleuth? I
guess I was a little slow in understanding. But you
seem to be right. This is the third mystery you&rsquo;ve
solved. Maybe we will use you on the next mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dad,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;I just hope I won&rsquo;t
have to wait too long for the next mystery to come
along.&rdquo;</p>
